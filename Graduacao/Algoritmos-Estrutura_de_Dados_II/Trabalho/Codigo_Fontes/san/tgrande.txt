The Old Testament of the King James Version of the Bible

The First Book of Moses  Called Genesis


 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.

 And God said, Let there be light and there was light.

 And God saw the light, that it was good and God divided the light
from the darkness.

 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament
and it was so.

 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.

 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear and it was so.

 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas and God saw that it was good.

 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
in itself, upon the earth and it was so.

 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
his kind and God saw that it was good.

 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years  And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was
so.

 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also.

 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth,  And to rule over the day and over the night, and
to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good.

 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.

 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind and God saw that it was good.

 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind and it was so.

 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind and God saw that it was good.

 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth.

 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat and it was so.

 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them.

 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it because that
in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens,  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it grew for the LORD God had not
caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the
ground.

 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.

 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed.

 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence
it was parted, and became into four heads.

 The name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseth the
whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  And the gold of that
land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

 And the name of the second river is Gihon the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel that is it which
goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it.

 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat  But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him.

 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof;  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made
he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh.

 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.

 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?   And the woman said
unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye die.

 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die 
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.

 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons.

 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?   And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life  And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field;  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken for
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother
of all living.

 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothed them.

 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever  Therefore the
LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground
from whence he was taken.

 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep
the way of the tree of life.

 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering  But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?   If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

 And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not Am I my brother's keeper?   And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground.

 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;  When thou
tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
bear.

 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one
that findeth me shall slay me.

 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark
upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch and he
builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
son, Enoch.

 And unto Enoch was born Irad and Irad begat Mehujael and
Mehujael begat Methusael and Methusael begat Lamech.

 And Lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was Adah,
and the name of the other Zillah.

 And Adah bare Jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
and of such as have cattle.

 And his brother's name was Jubal he was the father of all such
as handle the harp and organ.

 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;
ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to
my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
sevenfold.

 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
name Seth For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead
of Abel, whom Cain slew.

 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
name Enos then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
created man, in the likeness of God made he him;  Male and female
created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the
day when they were created.

 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his
own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth  And
the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years
and he begat sons and daughters  And all the days that Adam lived
were nine hundred and thirty years and he died.

 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos  And
Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and
begat sons and daughters  And all the days of Seth were nine
hundred and twelve years and he died.

 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan  And Enos lived
after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons
and daughters  And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and
five years and he died.

 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel  And
Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,
and begat sons and daughters  And all the days of Cainan were
nine hundred and ten years and he died.

 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared 
And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty
years, and begat sons and daughters  And all the days of
Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died.

 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
Enoch  And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,
and begat sons and daughters  And all the days of Jared were nine
hundred sixty and two years and he died.

 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah 
And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred
years, and begat sons and daughters  And all the days of Enoch
were three hundred sixty and five years  And Enoch walked with
God and he was not; for God took him.

 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat
Lamech.

 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty
and two years, and begat sons and daughters  And all the days of
Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died.

 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
son  And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground
which the LORD hath cursed.

 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five
years, and begat sons and daughters  And all the days of Lamech
were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died.

 And Noah was five hundred years old and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
and Japheth.

 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
earth, and daughters were born unto them,  That the sons of God saw
the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of
all which they chose.

 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years.

 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
renown.

 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.

 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart.

 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

 These are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled
with violence.

 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I
will destroy them with the earth.

 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty
cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under
heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.

 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives
with thee.

 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be
male and female.

 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort
shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
he.

 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
his female.

 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have
made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth.

 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,  There went in two
and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had
commanded Noah.

 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.

 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons
with them, into the ark;  They, and every beast after his kind,
and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,
every bird of every sort.

 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him and the LORD shut him in.

 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.

 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man  All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.

 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the
fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah
only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.

 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass over
the earth, and the waters asswaged;  The fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was
restrained;  And the waters returned from off the earth
continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
waters were abated.

 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the
tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the
mountains seen.

 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made  And he sent forth a raven,
which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off
the earth.

 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground;  But the dove found no rest
for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for
the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his
hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark;  And the dove came in to him in the evening;
and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so Noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth.

 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
which returned not again unto him any more.

 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
off the earth and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dried.

 And God spake unto Noah, saying,  Go forth of the ark, thou,
and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the
earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
wives with him  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every
fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
forth out of the ark.

 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
altar.

 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for
the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I
again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are
they delivered.

 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
green herb have I given you all things.

 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall
ye not eat.

 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of
every man's brother will I require the life of man.

 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed for in
the image of God made he man.

 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in
the earth, and multiply therein.

 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,  And
I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after
you;  And with every living creature that is with you, of the
fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall
there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for
perpetual generations  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall
be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud  And I will remember my
covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all
flesh.

 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that
I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which
I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
Ham, and Japheth and Ham is the father of Canaan.

 These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth
overspread.

 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard
 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent.

 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
and told his two brethren without.

 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's
nakedness.

 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.

 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren.

 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
his servant.

 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years and
he died.

 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood.

 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
Dodanim.

 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
and Sabtechah and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

 And Cush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD wherefore it is said,
Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
city Rehoboth, and Calah,  And Resen between Nineveh and Calah
the same is a great city.

 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
Caphtorim.

 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,  And the
Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,  And the Hivite,
and the Arkite, and the Sinite,  And the Arvadite, and the
Zemarite, and the Hamathite and afterward were the families of the
Canaanites spread abroad.

 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest
to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and
Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
and Aram.

 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

 And unto Eber were born two sons the name of one was Peleg; for
in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
Jerah,  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,  And Obal, and
Abimael, and Sheba,  And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab all these
were the sons of Joktan.

 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
mount of the east.

 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
generations, in their nations and by these were the nations divided
in the earth after the flood.

 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
morter.

 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded.

 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all
one language; and this they begin to do and now nothing will be
restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
they may not understand one another's speech.

 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth and they left off to build the city.

 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the
LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

 These are the generations of Shem Shem was an hundred years
old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood  And Shem
lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and
daughters.

 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah 
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,
and begat sons and daughters.

 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber  And Salah
lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons
and daughters.

 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg  And
Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and
begat sons and daughters.

 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu  And Peleg
lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons
and daughters.

 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug  And
Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat
sons and daughters.

 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor  And Serug
lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and
daughters.

 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah 
And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,
and begat sons and daughters.

 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
Haran.

 Now these are the generations of Terah Terah begat Abram,
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

 And Abram and Nahor took them wives the name of Abram's wife
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of
Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they
went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of
Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years and Terah
died in Haran.

 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I
will shew thee  And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a
blessing  And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him
that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed.

 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went
with him and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
out of Haran.

 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;
and into the land of Canaan they came.

 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
give this land and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him.

 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east
and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name
of the LORD.

 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

 And there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon  Therefore it shall come to pass, when
the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife
and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister that it may be well with
me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
Pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

 And he entreated Abram well for her sake and he had sheep, and
oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,
and camels.

 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of Sarai Abram's wife.

 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to
wife now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had.

 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the south.

 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and
Hai;  Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
first and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.

 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
together for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
together.

 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and
the herdmen of Lot's cattle and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
dwelled then in the land.

 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
brethren.

 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
from me if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;
or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
as thou comest unto Zoar.

 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
east and they separated themselves the one from the other.

 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
exceedingly.

 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward  For all
the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for
ever.

 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered.

 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of
nations;  That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
the salt sea.

 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled.

 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the
Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,  And the
Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.

 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that
dwelt in Hazezontamar.

 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of
Siddim;  With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king
of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
four kings with five.

 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled
to the mountain.

 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
victuals, and went their way.

 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
and his goods, and departed.

 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and
brother of Aner and these were confederate with Abram.

 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and
eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the
left hand of Damascus.

 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from
the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at
the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and
he was the priest of the most high God.

 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high
God, possessor of heaven and earth  And blessed be the most high
God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him
tithes of all.

 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and
take the goods to thyself.

 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,
I have made Abram rich  Save only that which the young men have
eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,
and Mamre; let them take their portion.

 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
vision, saying, Fear not, Abram I am thy shield, and thy exceeding
great reward.

 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed and, lo,
one born in my house is mine heir.

 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own
bowels shall be thine heir.

 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them and he
said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
righteousness.

 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
it?   And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a
turtledove, and a young pigeon.

 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not.

 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
away.

 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and
they shall afflict them four hundred years;  And also that
nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge and afterward shall they
come out with great substance.

 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried
in a good old age.

 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for
the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between
those pieces.

 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the
great river, the river Euphrates  The Kenites, and the
Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,  And the Hittites, and the
Perizzites, and the Rephaims,  And the Amorites, and the
Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children and she had an
handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained
me from bearing I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her
husband Abram to be his wife.

 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived and when she saw
that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee I have given my
maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was
despised in her eyes the LORD judge between me and thee.

 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do
to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she
fled from her face.

 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither
wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
and submit thyself under her hands.

 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because
the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren.

 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
God seest me for she said, Have I also here looked after him that
seeth me?   Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,
it is between Kadesh and Bered.

 And Hagar bare Abram a son and Abram called his son's name,
which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
Ishmael to Abram.

 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared
to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,
and be thou perfect.

 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
multiply thee exceedingly.

 And Abram fell on his face and God talked with him, saying, 
As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a
father of many nations.

 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an
everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and
thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall
be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or
bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
money, must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your
flesh for an everlasting covenant.

 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath
broken my covenant.

 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her yea, I
will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people
shall be of her.

 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?
and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?   And Abraham
said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!   And God
said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call
his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an
everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee Behold, I have blessed
him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;
twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the
men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in
the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
son.

 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre and he sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day;  And he lift up his eyes
and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him and when he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the
ground,  And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy
sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant  Let a little
water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves
under the tree  And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort
ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come
to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes
upon the hearth.

 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,
and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they
did eat.

 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
Behold, in the tent.

 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah
heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed
old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?   And the LORD
said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a
surety bear a child, which am old?   Is any thing too hard for
the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to
the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom and
Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
do;  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do
justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which
he hath spoken of him.

 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great, and because their sin is very grievous;  I will go down
now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of
it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked?   Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the
place for the fifty righteous that are therein?   That be far
from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the
wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far
from thee Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?   And
the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes 
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou
destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there
forty and five, I will not destroy it.

 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's
sake.

 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
speak Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I
will not do it, if I find thirty there.

 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
LORD Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I
will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet
but this once Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I
will not destroy it for ten's sake.

 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place.

 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground;  And he said, Behold now,
my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry
all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on
your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all
night.

 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake
unleavened bread, and they did eat.

 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people
from every quarter  And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,
Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out
unto us, that we may know them.

 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after
him,  And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good
in your eyes only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they
under the shadow of my roof.

 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow
came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge now will we deal
worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,
even Lot, and came near to break the door.

 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house
to them, and shut to the door.

 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
blindness, both small and great so that they wearied themselves to
find the door.

 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the
city, bring them out of this place  For we will destroy this
place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the
LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.

 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married
his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD
will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons
in law.

 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon
the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD
being merciful unto him and they brought him forth, and set him
without the city.

 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD  Behold now,
thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy
mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot
escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die 
Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one
Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall
live.

 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou
hast spoken.

 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
fire from the LORD out of heaven;  And he overthrew those cities,
and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that
which grew upon the ground.

 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
pillar of salt.

 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
stood before the LORD  And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,
and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the
overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his
two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar and he dwelt
in a cave, he and his two daughters.

 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of
all the earth  Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we
will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

 And they made their father drink wine that night and the
firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when
she lay down, nor when she arose.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto
the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father let us make him
drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we
may preserve seed of our father.

 And they made their father drink wine that night also and the
younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose.

 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab the
same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
Benammi the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this
day.

 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister and
Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;
for she is a man's wife.

 But Abimelech had not come near her and he said, LORD, wilt thou
slay also a righteous nation?   Said he not unto me, She is my
sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother in the
integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.

 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from
sinning against me therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and
he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live and if thou restore her
not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are
thine.

 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
servants, and told all these things in their ears and the men were
sore afraid.

 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou
done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on
me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that
ought not to be done.

 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
hast done this thing?   And Abraham said, Because I thought,
Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for
my wife's sake.

 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou
shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,
He is my brother.

 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his
wife.

 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee dwell where
it pleaseth thee.

 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
thousand pieces of silver behold, he is to thee a covering of the
eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other thus she was
reproved.

 So Abraham prayed unto God and God healed Abimelech, and his
wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto
Sarah as he had spoken.

 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
the set time of which God had spoken to him.

 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
God had commanded him.

 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
unto him.

 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear
will laugh with me.

 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

 And the child grew, and was weaned and Abraham made a great
feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born
unto Abraham, mocking.

 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even
with Isaac.

 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
his son.

 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
seed be called.

 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
because he is thy seed.

 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,
and the child, and sent her away and she departed, and wandered in
the wilderness of Beersheba.

 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
under one of the shrubs.

 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,
as it were a bow shot for she said, Let me not see the death of the
child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?
fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.

 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
make him a great nation.

 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
wilderness, and became an archer.

 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran and his mother took him
a wife out of the land of Egypt.

 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee
in all that thou doest  Now therefore swear unto me here by God
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my
son's son but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,
thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

 And Abraham said, I will swear.

 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither
didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
and both of them made a covenant.

 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
which thou hast set by themselves?   And he said, For these seven
ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto
me, that I have digged this well.

 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
sware both of them.

 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba then Abimelech rose up,
and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the
land of the Philistines.

 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham and he said, Behold, here I am.

 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for
a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave
the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place
of which God had told him.

 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
place afar off.

 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they
went both of them together.

 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father and
he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?   And Abraham said, My
son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they
went both of them together.

 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay
his son.

 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
said, Abraham, Abraham and he said, Here am I.

 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
any thing unto him for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took
the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his
son.

 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh as it is
said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.

 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the
second time,  And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,
for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
thine only son  That in blessing I will bless thee, and in
multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and
as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess
the gate of his enemies;  And in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.

 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy
brother Nahor;  Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and
Kemuel the father of Aram,  And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,
and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

 And Bethuel begat Rebekah these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
Abraham's brother.

 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these
were the years of the life of Sarah.

 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
sons of Heth, saying,  I am a stranger and a sojourner with you
give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my
dead out of my sight.

 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
Hear us, my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of
our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
land, even to the children of Heth.

 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to
Ephron the son of Zohar,  That he may give me the cave of
Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as
much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a
buryingplace amongst you.

 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth and Ephron the
Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even
of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,  Nay, my
lord, hear me the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I
give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee
bury thy dead.

 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me I will
give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead
there.

 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,  My lord,
hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;
what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron
the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,
four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before
Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees
that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were
made sure  Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the
children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
field of Machpelah before Mamre the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan.

 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age and the LORD had
blessed Abraham in all things.

 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh 
And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God
of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell  But thou shalt
go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son
Isaac.

 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest?   And Abraham said unto
him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.

 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and
from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware
unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send
his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
thence.

 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again.

 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he
arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well
of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out
to draw water.

 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of
the men of the city come out to draw water  And let it come to
pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I
pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give
thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed
for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed
kindness unto my master.

 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had
any man known her and she went down to the well, and filled her
pitcher, and came up.

 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
drink a little water of thy pitcher.

 And she said, Drink, my lord and she hasted, and let down her
pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the
LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets
for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;  And said, Whose
daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee is there room in thy father's
house for us to lodge in?   And she said unto him, I am the
daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
enough, and room to lodge in.

 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth I being
in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.

 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
things.

 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban and Laban ran
out unto the man, unto the well.

 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon
his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
behold, he stood by the camels at the well.

 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the
camels.

 And the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels, and
gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,
and the men's feet that were with him.

 And there was set meat before him to eat but he said, I will
not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
great and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,
and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was
old and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife
to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell
 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and
take a wife unto my son.

 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
follow me.

 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his
angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for
my son of my kindred, and of my father's house  Then shalt thou
be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if
they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.

 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go 
Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that
when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,
I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;  And she say
to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels let the
same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's
son.

 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto
the well, and drew water and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray
thee.

 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also so I drank,
and she made the camels drink also.

 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him
and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way
to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
me and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the
left.

 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
from the LORD we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be
thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah he gave also to her
brother and to her mother precious things.

 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,
Send me away unto my master.

 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
mouth.

 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
this man? And she said, I will go.

 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
Abraham's servant, and his men.

 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed
possess the gate of those which hate them.

 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
camels, and followed the man and the servant took Rebekah, and went
his way.

 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
in the south country.

 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and
he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.

 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
lighted off the camel.

 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh
in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master
therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her and Isaac was
comforted after his mother's death.

 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
Ishbak, and Shuah.

 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,
and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham
gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
eastward, unto the east country.

 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which
is before Mamre;  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons
of Heth there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed
his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham  And
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according
to their generations the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,
and Adbeel, and Mibsam,  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah  These are the sons
of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their
castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died; and was
gathered unto his people.

 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as
thou goest toward Assyria and he died in the presence of all his
brethren.

 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son Abraham
begat Isaac  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah
to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister
to Laban the Syrian.

 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
barren and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife
conceived.

 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.

 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one
people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall
serve the younger.

 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there
were twins in her womb.

 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and
they called his name Esau.

 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was threescore
years old when she bare them.

 And the boys grew and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison but
Rebekah loved Jacob.

 And Jacob sod pottage and Esau came from the field, and he was
faint  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that
same red pottage; for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom.

 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die and what profit
shall this birthright do to me?   And Jacob said, Swear to me
this day; and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto
Jacob.

 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way thus Esau despised his
birthright.

 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that
was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar.

 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of  Sojourn in this
land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and
unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the
oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;  And I will make thy
seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed
all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed;  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept
my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar  And the men of the place asked him
of his wife; and he said, She is my sister for he feared to say, She
is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for
Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.

 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,
and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is
thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto
him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest
have brought guiltiness upon us.

 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
hundredfold and the LORD blessed him.

 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
became very great  For he had possession of flocks, and
possession of herds, and great store of servants and the Philistines
envied him.

 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the
days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and
filled them with earth.

 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
mightier than we.

 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
Gerar, and dwelt there.

 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged
in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped
them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the
names by which his father had called them.

 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
well of springing water.

 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
saying, The water is ours and he called the name of the well Esek;
because they strove with him.

 And they digged another well, and strove for that also and he
called the name of it Sitnah.

 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
that they strove not and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he
said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful
in the land.

 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
the God of Abraham thy father fear not, for I am with thee, and will
bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
LORD, and pitched his tent there and there Isaac's servants digged a
well.

 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
hate me, and have sent me away from you?   And they said, We saw
certainly that the LORD was with thee and we said, Let there be now
an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a
covenant with thee;  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not
touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have
sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
another and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in
peace.

 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto
him, We have found water.

 And he called it Shebah therefore the name of the city is
Beersheba unto this day.

 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
Hittite  Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were
dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said
unto him, My son and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.

 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
death  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver
and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 
And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I
may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went
to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,  Bring me venison, and
make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD
before my death.

 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
command thee.

 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as
he loveth  And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may
eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is
a hairy man, and I am a smooth man  My father peradventure will
feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a
curse upon me, and not a blessing.

 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son only
obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother and
his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son
 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
and upon the smooth of his neck  And she gave the savoury meat
and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

 And he came unto his father, and said, My father and he said,
Here am I; who art thou, my son?   And Jacob said unto his
father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest
me arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may
bless me.

 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it
to me.

 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
brother Esau's hands so he blessed him.

 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,
and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank.

 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,
my son.

 And he came near, and kissed him and he smelled the smell of
his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as
the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed  Therefore God
give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and
plenty of corn and wine  Let people serve thee, and nations bow
down to thee be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow
down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he
that blesseth thee.

 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of
Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his
son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I
am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he
that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all
before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be
blessed.

 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,
even me also, O my father.

 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away
thy blessing.

 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright; and,
behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me?   And Isaac answered and said unto
Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I
given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained
him and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?   And Esau said
unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even
me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven
from above;  And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve
thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the
dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
father blessed him and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning
for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah and
she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,
thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to
kill thee.

 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban
my brother to Haran;  And tarry with him a few days, until thy
brother's fury turn away;  Until thy brother's anger turn away
from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him then I will
send, and fetch thee from thence why should I be deprived also of you
both in one day?   And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my
life because of the daughters of Heth if Jacob take a wife of the
daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the
land, what good shall my life do me?   And Isaac called Jacob, and
blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a
wife of the daughters of Canaan.

 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy
mother's brother.

 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;  And give thee
the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou
mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave
unto Abraham.

 And Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,
son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's
mother.

 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him
he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the
daughers of Canaan;  And that Jacob obeyed his father and his
mother, and was gone to Padanaram;  And Esau seeing that the
daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;  Then went Esau
unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the
daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his
wife.

 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that
place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to
sleep.

 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the
top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending
and descending on it.

 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac the land whereon thou
liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;  And thy seed
shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the
west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south and in thee
and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I
will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to
thee of.

 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD
is in this place; and I knew it not.

 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is
none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil
upon the top of it.

 And he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of
that city was called Luz at the first.

 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will
keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and
raiment to put on,  So that I come again to my father's house in
peace; then shall the LORD be my God  And this stone, which I
have set for a pillar, shall be God's house and of all that thou
shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
people of the east.

 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they
watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

 And thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the
stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well's mouth in his place.

 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
said, Of Haran are we.

 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
said, We know him.

 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well
and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep, and go and
feed them.

 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we
water the sheep.

 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's
sheep; for she kept them.

 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban
his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,
that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and
watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that
he was Rebekah's son and she ran and told her father.

 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed
him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And
he abode with him the space of a month.

 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy
wages be?   And Laban had two daughters the name of the elder
was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
favoured.

 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years
for Rachel thy younger daughter.

 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that
I should give her to another man abide with me.

 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
feast.

 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.

 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah
and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
the younger before the firstborn.

 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week and he gave him Rachel
his daughter to wife also.

 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
her maid.

 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb
but Rachel was barren.

 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
Reuben for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;
now therefore my husband will love me.

 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also
and she called his name Simeon.

 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time
will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons
therefore was his name called Levi.

 And she conceived again, and bare a son and she said, Now will
I praise the LORD therefore she called his name Judah; and left
bearing.

 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I
die.

 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel and he said, Am I
in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.

 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife and Jacob went in
unto her.

 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
voice, and hath given me a son therefore called she his name Dan.

 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second
son.

 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
sister, and I have prevailed and she called his name Naphtali.

 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

 And Leah said, A troop cometh and she called his name Gad.

 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
blessed and she called his name Asher.

 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then
Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken
my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And
Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's
mandrakes.

 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I
have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that
night.

 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
the fifth son.

 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
my maiden to my husband and she called his name Issachar.

 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my
husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons and she
called his name Zebulun.

 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened
her womb.

 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away
my reproach  And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD
shall add to me another son.

 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and
to my country.

 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
and let me go for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
thine eyes, tarry for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath
blessed me for thy sake.

 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
how thy cattle was with me.

 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my
coming and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  
And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not
give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again
feed and keep thy flock.

 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among
the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such
shall be my hire.

 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled
and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be
counted stolen with me.

 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
word.

 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and
every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the
sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob and
Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white
appear which was in the rods.

 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that
they should conceive when they came to drink.

 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of
Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto
Laban's cattle.

 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in
the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.

 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in so the
feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's
hath he gotten all this glory.

 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
not toward him as before.

 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
flock,  And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that
it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with
me.

 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;
but God suffered him not to hurt me.

 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
cattle bare speckled and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be
thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
them to me.

 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that
I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which
leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob
And I said, Here am I.

 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled for I
have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise, get thee out from this
land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?   Are we not
counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured
also our money.

 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
ours, and our children's now then, whatsoever God hath said unto
thee, do.

 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

 And Laban went to shear his sheep and Rachel had stolen the
images that were her father's.

 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
told him not that he fled.

 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over
the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
mount and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives
taken with the sword?   Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,
and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent
thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou
hast now done foolishly in so doing.

 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the God of
your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that
thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
gods?   And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was
afraid for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
daughters from me.

 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live before
our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into
the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out
of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but
found them not.

 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he
searched but found not the images.

 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban and Jacob answered
and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast
so hotly pursued after me?   Whereas thou hast searched all my
stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here
before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us
both.

 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not
eaten.

 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by
day, or stolen by night.

 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle
and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God
hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee
yesternight.

 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my
cattle, and all that thou seest is mine and what can I do this day
unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and
let it be for a witness between me and thee.

 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
stones, and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap.

 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha but Jacob called it Galeed.

 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this
day.

Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;  And Mizpah; for he
said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from
another.

 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness
betwixt me and thee.

 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee  This heap be
witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this
heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this
pillar unto me, for harm.

 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father
Isaac.

 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread, and tarried all night
in the mount.

 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and
his daughters, and blessed them and Laban departed, and returned unto
his place.

 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host and he
called the name of that place Mahanaim.

 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
land of Seir, the country of Edom.

 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and
stayed there until now  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and
menservants, and womenservants and I have sent to tell my lord, that
I may find grace in thy sight.

 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men
with him.

 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the
people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,
into two bands;  And said, If Esau come to the one company, and
smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to
thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee  I am not worthy of
the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast
shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;
and now I am become two bands.

 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
hand of Esau for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the
mother with the children.

 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came
to his hand a present for Esau his brother;  Two hundred she
goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,
twenty she asses, and ten foals.

 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove
by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and
put a space betwixt drove and drove.

 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither
goest thou? and whose are these before thee?   Then thou shalt
say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord
Esau and, behold, also he is behind us.

 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,
when ye find him.

 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For
he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and
afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

 So went the present over before him and himself lodged that
night in the company.

 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
that he had.

 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
until the breaking of the day.

 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of
joint, as he wrestled with him.

 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel
for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast
prevailed.

 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he
blessed him there.

 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel for I have seen
God face to face, and my life is preserved.

 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
halted upon his thigh.

 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day because
he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,
and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,
and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to his brother.

 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,
and kissed him and they wept.

 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God
hath graciously given thy servant.

 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
bowed themselves.

 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves
and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And
he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
unto thyself.

 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
thy sight, then receive my present at my hand for therefore I have
seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast
pleased with me.

 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because
God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he
urged him, and he took it.

 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will
go before thee.

 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men
should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant and I
will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and
the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the
sight of my lord.

 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called
Succoth.

 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent
before the city.

 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,
at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred
pieces of money.

 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went
out to see the daughters of the land.

 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved
the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
damsel to wife.

 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter now his
sons were with his cattle in the field and Jacob held his peace until
they were come.

 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
with him.

 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it
and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had
wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter which thing
ought not to be done.

 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
longeth for your daughter I pray you give her him to wife.

 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,
and take our daughters unto you.

 And ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you;
dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife.

 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister
 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us
 But in this will we consent unto you If ye will be as we be,
that every male of you be circumcised;  Then will we give our
daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will
dwell with you, and we will become one people.

 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will
we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
delight in Jacob's daughter and he was more honourable than all the
house of his father.

 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,
and communed with the men of their city, saying,  These men are
peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade
therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us
take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our
daughters.

 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are
circumcised.

 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell
with us.

 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went
out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that
went out of the gate of his city.

 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that
two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each
man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.

 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
because they had defiled their sister.

 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
which was in the city, and that which was in the field,  And all
their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they
captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites
and the Perizzites and I being few in number, they shall gather
themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,
I and my house.

 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there
and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and
change your garments  And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and
I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my
distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid
them under the oak which was by Shechem.

 And they journeyed and the terror of God was upon the cities
that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of
Jacob.

 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel
because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his
brother.

 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
Bethel under an oak and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,
and blessed him.

 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be
called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name and he called his
name Israel.

 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty be fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and
kings shall come out of thy loins;  And the land which I gave
Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee
will I give the land.

 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he
poured oil thereon.

 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
Bethel.

 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
to come to Ephrath and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
died) that she called his name Benoni but his father called him
Benjamin.

 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is
Bethlehem.

 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of
Rachel's grave unto this day.

 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
Edar.

 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben
went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine and Israel heard it.
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve  The sons of Leah; Reuben,
Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and
Zebulun  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin  And the
sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali  And the
sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid Gad, and Asher these are the sons of
Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his
people, being old and full of days and his sons Esau and Jacob buried
him.

 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter
of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter
of Zibeon the Hivite;  And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of
Nebajoth.

 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;  And
Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah these are the sons of
Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all
the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all
his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into
the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because
of their cattle.

 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir Esau is Edom.

 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
in mount Seir  These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the
son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of
Esau.

 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
Kenaz.

 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
Eliphaz Amalek these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and
Mizzah these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the

 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
duke Jaalam, duke Korah these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah

 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
dukes.

 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,  And Dishon, and Ezer,
and Dishan these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir
in the land of Edom.

 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
sister was Timna.

 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and
Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah this
was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the
asses of Zibeon his father.

 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the
daughter of Anah.

 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
Ithran, and Cheran.

 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,  Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke
Dishan these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in
the land of Seir.

 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom and the name of his
city was Dinhabah.

 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
his stead.

 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his
stead.

 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in
the field of Moab, reigned in his stead and the name of his city was
Avith.

 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in

 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
stead and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was
Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

duke Pinon,  Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,  Duke
Magdiel, duke Iram these be the dukes of Edom, according to their
habitations in the land of their possession he is Esau the father of
the Edomites.

 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in
the land of Canaan.

 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the
sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives and
Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours.

 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than
all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto
him.

 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren and they
hated him yet the more.

 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed  For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,
lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the
more for his dreams, and for his words.

 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and
the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren and his
father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou
hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to
bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?   And his brethren
envied him; but his father observed the saying.

 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock
in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,
Here am I.

 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with
thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he
sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
the field and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  
And he said, I seek my brethren tell me, I pray thee, where they feed
their flocks.

 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,
Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found
them in Dothan.

 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
them, they conspired against him to slay him.

 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall
see what will become of his dreams.

 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
and said, Let us not kill him.

 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this
pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might
rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that
was on him;  And they took him, and cast him into a pit and the
pit was empty, there was no water in it.

 And they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes
and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead
with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry
it down to Egypt.

 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
our brother, and conceal his blood?   Come, and let us sell him
to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our
brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.

 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in
the pit; and he rent his clothes.

 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
and I, whither shall I go?   And they took Joseph's coat, and
killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;  And
they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their
father; and said, This have we found know now whether it be thy son's
coat or no.

 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
and mourned for his son many days.

 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into
the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer
of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
Onan.

 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
Shelah and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.

 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;
and the LORD slew him.

 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on
the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD wherefore he
slew him also.

 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at
thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown for he said, Lest
peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and
dwelt in her father's house.

 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;
and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to
Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up
to Timnath to shear his sheep.

 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is
by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was
not given unto him to wife.

 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she
had covered her face.

 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,
let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter
in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come
in unto me?   And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.
And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  
And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,
and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it
her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and
put on the garments of her widowhood.

 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
to receive his pledge from the woman's hand but he found her not.

 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no
harlot in this place.

 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also
the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.

 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed
behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and
also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her
forth, and let her be burnt.

 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child and she said,
Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and
staff.

 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he
knew her again no more.

 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
twins were in her womb.

 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet
thread, saying, This came out first.

 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
brother came out and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this
breach be upon thee therefore his name was called Pharez.

 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread
upon his hand and his name was called Zarah.

 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he
was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD
made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him and he
made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his
hand.

 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the
Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was
upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.

 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly
person, and well favoured.

 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed
all that he hath to my hand;  There is none greater in this house
than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because
thou art his wife how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin
against God?   And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by
day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house
there within.

 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me and he
left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
in her hand, and was fled forth,  That she called unto the men of
her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an
Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I
cried with a loud voice  And it came to pass, when he heard that
I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and
fled, and got him out.

 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to
mock me  And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,
that he left his garment with me, and fled out.

 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy
servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the
prison.

 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he
was the doer of it.

 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the
LORD made it to prosper.

 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
served them and they continued a season in ward.

 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the
prison.

 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
them, and, behold, they were sad.

 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of
his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?   And
they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;  And in the vine were
three branches and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot
forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes  And
Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes, and pressed them
into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it The
three branches are three days  Yet within three days shall
Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place and thou
shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner
when thou wast his butler.

 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
and bring me out of this house  For indeed I was stolen away out
of the land of the Hebrews and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon.

 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three
white baskets on my head  And in the uppermost basket there was
of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out
of the basket upon my head.

 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
thereof The three baskets are three days  Yet within three days
shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a
tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,
that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and
he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand  But he hanged the chief
baker as Joseph had interpreted to them.

 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
dreamed and, behold, he stood by the river.

 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon
the brink of the river.

 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

 And he slept and dreamed the second time and, behold, seven ears
of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
sprung up after them.

 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;
and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the
wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none
that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
my faults this day  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put
me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief
baker  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed
each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us
our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself, and changed his
raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there
is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of thee, that thou
canst understand a dream to interpret it.

 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me God shall
give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon
the bank of the river  And, behold, there came up out of the
river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a
meadow  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor
and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the
land of Egypt for badness  And the lean and the ill favoured
kine did eat up the first seven fat kine  And when they had
eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but
they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
stalk, full and good  And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,
and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them  And the
thin ears devoured the seven good ears and I told this unto the
magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.

 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one God
hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
seven years the dream is one.

 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind
shall be seven years of famine.

 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh What God is
about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
the land of Egypt  And there shall arise after them seven years
of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;
and the famine shall consume the land;  And the plenty shall not
be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall
be very grievous.

 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it
to pass.

 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and
set him over the land of Egypt.

 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,
and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
years.

 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,
and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in
the cities.

 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land
perish not through the famine.

 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
of all his servants.

 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?   And Pharaoh said
unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none
so discreet and wise as thou art  Thou shalt be over my house,
and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the
throne will I be greater than thou.

 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
land of Egypt.

 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a
gold chain about his neck;  And he made him to ride in the second
chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee and he
made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And
Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and
went throughout all the land of Egypt.

 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
handfuls.

 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities the food of
the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
until he left numbering; for it was without number.

 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto
him.

 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh For God,
said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

 And the name of the second called he Ephraim For God hath
caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
Egypt, were ended.

 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph
had said and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of
Egypt there was bread.

 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

 And the famine was over all the face of the earth and Joseph
opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the
famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?   And he said, Behold,
I have heard that there is corn in Egypt get you down thither, and
buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came
for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brethren came, and
bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are
come.

 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
servants come.

 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
spies.

 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come.

 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one
man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with
our father, and one is not.

 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
saying, Ye are spies  Hereby ye shall be proved By the life of
Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come
hither.

 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any
truth in you or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

 And he put them all together into ward three days.

 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for
I fear God  If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound
in the house of your prison go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
houses  But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your
words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought
us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,
behold, also his blood is required.

 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
them by an interpreter.

 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and
bound him before their eyes.

 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision
for the way and thus did he unto them.

 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it
is even in my sack and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,
saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
told him all that befell unto them; saying,  The man, who is the
lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the
country.

 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies  We
be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest
is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall
I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,
and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone 
And bring your youngest brother unto me then shall I know that ye are
no spies, but that ye are true men so will I deliver you your
brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
every man's bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and
their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
children Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin
away all these things are against me.

 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him
to thee again.

 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother
is dead, and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in
the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
the grave.

 And the famine was sore in the land.

 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they
had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy
us a little food.

 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with
you.

 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
thee food  But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down
for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
brother be with you.

 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
the man whether ye had yet a brother?   And they said, The man
asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your
father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according
to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would
say, Bring your brother down?   And Judah said unto Israel his
father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may
live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.

 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him if I
bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
blame for ever  For except we had lingered, surely now we had
returned this second time.

 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and
myrrh, nuts, and almonds  And take double money in your hand;
and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry
it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight  Take
also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man  And God
Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your
other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am
bereaved.

 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and
stood before Joseph.

 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of
his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these
men shall dine with me at noon.

 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
Joseph's house.

 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
communed with him at the door of the house,  And said, O sir, we
came indeed down at the first time to buy food  And it came to
pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,
every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full
weight and we have brought it again in our hand.

 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not your God, and the God of
your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks I had your money.
And he brought Simeon out unto them.

 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon for
they heard that they should eat bread there.

 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the
earth.

 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?   And they
answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.
And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake
unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
brother and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,
and wept there.

 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
said, Set on bread.

 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,
and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves because
the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an
abomination unto the Egyptians.

 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
birthright, and the youngest according to his youth and the men
marvelled one at another.

 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him but
Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they
drank, and were merry with him.

 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's
sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money
in his sack's mouth.

 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that
Joseph had spoken.

 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
and their asses.

 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou
dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for
good?   Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby
indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing 
Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought
again unto thee out of the land of Canaan how then should we steal
out of thy lord's house silver or gold?   With whomsoever of thy
servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's
bondmen.

 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words he
with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
and opened every man his sack.

 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
youngest and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
returned to the city.

 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
yet there and they fell before him on the ground.

 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?   And Judah
said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how
shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
servants behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with
whom the cup is found.

 And he said, God forbid that I should do so but the man in
whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,
get you up in peace unto your father.

 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not
thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as Pharaoh.

 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
brother?   And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old
man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is
dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that
I may set mine eyes upon him.

 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father for
if he should leave his father, his father would die.

 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother
come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,
we told him the words of my lord.

 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

 And we said, We cannot go down if our youngest brother be with
us, then will we go down for we may not see the man's face, except
our youngest brother be with us.

 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
bare me two sons  And the one went out from me, and I said,
Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since  And if ye
take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down
my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad
be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
us, that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs
of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to
my father for ever.

 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the
lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?
lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood
by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there
stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his
brethren.

 And he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
heard.

 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
troubled at his presence.

 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.
And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye
sold into Egypt.

 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye
sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life.

 For these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet
there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor
harvest.

 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God and he hath
made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler
throughout all the land of Egypt.

 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt come down unto me,
tarry not  And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou
shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast 
And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;
lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
Benjamin wept upon his neck.

 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them and
after that his brethren talked with him.

 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
Joseph's brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his
servants.

 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;  And
take your father and your households, and come unto me and I will
give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of
the land.

 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your
father, and come.

 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
Egypt is your's.

 And the children of Israel did so and Joseph gave them wagons,
according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
the way.

 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of
raiment.

 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and
bread and meat for his father by the way.

 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed and he said
unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan
unto Jacob their father,  And told him, saying, Joseph is yet
alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's
heart fainted, for he believed them not.

 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
unto them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry
him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived  And Israel said,
It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and see him before
I die.

 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father fear not to go down
into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation  I will
go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up
again and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba and the sons of Israel carried
Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his
seed with him  His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his
daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with
him into Egypt.

 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
into Egypt, Jacob and his sons Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
Carmi.

 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
Zarah but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of
Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
Shimron.

 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah all the souls of his sons and his
daughters were thirty and three.

 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,
and Arodi, and Areli.

 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,
and Serah their sister and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare
unto him.

 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob all the
souls were fourteen.

 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
Shillem.

 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob all the souls were seven.

 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of
his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore
and six;  And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,
were two souls all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
Egypt, were threescore and ten.

 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on
his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
thy face, because thou art yet alive.

 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,
I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my
father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all
that they have.

 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
shall say, What is your occupation?   That ye shall say, Thy
servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,
both we, and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of
Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,
are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land
of Goshen.

 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
them unto Pharaoh.

 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And
they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also
our fathers.

 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the
famine is sore in the land of Canaan now therefore, we pray thee, let
thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
brethren are come unto thee  The land of Egypt is before thee; in
the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the
land of Goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity
among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
Pharaoh and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?   And Jacob
said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an
hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of
my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the
life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land
of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
father's household, with bread, according to their families.

 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by
reason of the famine.

 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land
of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought
and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread
for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
cattle, if money fail.

 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph and Joseph gave them
bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle
of the herds, and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all
their cattle for that year.

 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our
money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not
ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands
 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?
buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants
unto Pharaoh and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that
the land be not desolate.

 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over
them so the land became Pharaoh's.

 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of
the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had
a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands.

 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall
sow the land.

 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for
seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,
and for food for your little ones.

 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in
the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the
priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied
exceedingly.

 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years so the
whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die and he called his
son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly
with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt  But I will lie with
my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their
buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
bowed himself upon the bed's head.

 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
Behold, thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim.

 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
thee and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz
in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,  And said unto me, Behold,
I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee
a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee
for an everlasting possession.

 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto
thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are
mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their
inheritance.

 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the
land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come
unto Ephrath and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same
is Bethlehem.

 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  
And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given
me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I
will bless them.

 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
see.

And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
them.

 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face
and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
himself with his face to the earth.

 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's
right hand, and brought them near unto him.

 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's
head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto
this day,  The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the
lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of
the earth.

 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
head of Ephraim, it displeased him and he held up his father's hand,
to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father for this is
the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it
he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great but truly
his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall
become a multitude of nations.

 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh and he set
Ephraim before Manasseh.

 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die but God shall be
with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my
bow.

 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
days.

 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
hearken unto Israel your father.

 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power 
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to
thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch.

 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
habitations.

 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,
mine honour, be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man,
and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
was cruel I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall
be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down
before thee.

 Judah is a lion's whelp from the prey, my son, thou art gone up
he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall
rouse him up?   The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a
lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall
the gathering of the people be.

 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the
blood of grapes  His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth
white with milk.

 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for
an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto
tribute.

 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

 Gad, a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the
last.

 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
dainties.

 Naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words.

 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
whose branches run over the wall  The archers have sorely
grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him  But his bow abode
in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands
of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of
Israel)  Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and
by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and
of the womb  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above
the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
everlasting hills they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the
crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour
the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is it that
their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to
his blessing he blessed them.

 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the
field of Ephron the Hittite,  In the cave that is in the field of
Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham
bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
buryingplace.

 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
from the children of Heth.

 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was
gathered unto his people.

 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and
kissed him.

 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
father and the physicians embalmed Israel.

 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the
days of those which are embalmed and the Egyptians mourned for him
threescore and ten days.

 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,  My father made
me swear, saying, Lo, I die in my grave which I have digged for me in
the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go
up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
made thee swear.

 And Joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all
the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders
of the land of Egypt,  And all the house of Joseph, and his
brethren, and his father's house only their little ones, and their
flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was
a very great company.

 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation
and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning
to the Egyptians wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,
which is beyond Jordan.

 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them 
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before
Mamre.

 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his
father.

 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they
said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
all the evil which we did unto him.

 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
command before he died, saying,  So shall ye say unto Joseph,
Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;
for they did unto thee evil and now, we pray thee, forgive the
trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept
when they spake unto him.

 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not for am I in the place of
God?   But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant
it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people
alive.

 Now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you, and your little
ones.

And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house and
Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation the
children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
Joseph's knees.

 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die and God will surely
visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware
to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old and they
embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.




The Second Book of Moses  Called Exodus


 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,  Issachar, Zebulun, and
Benjamin,  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
souls for Joseph was in Egypt already.

 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land
was filled with them.

 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
Israel are more and mightier than we  Come on, let us deal wisely
with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there
falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight
against us, and so get them up out of the land.

 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
Raamses.

 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
grew.

And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
rigour  And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in
morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field all
their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah  And
he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and
see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him but
if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children
alive?   And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew
women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people
multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
made them houses.

 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save
alive.

 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
daughter of Levi.

 And the woman conceived, and bare a son and when she saw him that
he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she
saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

 And when she had opened it, she saw the child and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the
Hebrews' children.

 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to
thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
thee?   And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went
and called the child's mother.

 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took
the child, and nursed it.

 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,
and he became her son. And she called his name Moses and she said,
Because I drew him out of the water.

 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens and he spied
an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
Hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong,
Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?   And he said, Who made thee a
prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou
killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing
is known.

 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian
and he sat down by a well.

 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came and
drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

 And the shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up
and helped them, and watered their flock.

 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that
ye are come so soon to day?   And they said, An Egyptian delivered
us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for
us, and watered the flock.

 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that
ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

 And Moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses
Zipporah his daughter.

 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom for he
said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and
they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect
unto them.

 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and
came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
of the midst of a bush and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned
with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,
why the bush is not burnt.

 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,
Here am I.

 And he said, Draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy
feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he
was afraid to look upon God.

 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;  And I am come down to
deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up
out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing
with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the
Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and
the Jebusites.

 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come
unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians
oppress them.

 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
token unto thee, that I have sent thee When thou hast brought forth
the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
unto them?   And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM and he said,
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
unto you.

 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you this is
my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,
The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen
that which is done to you in Egypt  And I have said, I will bring
you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,
and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

 And they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come, thou
and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say
unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us
go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we
may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not
by a mighty hand.

 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will
let you go.

 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians
and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your
daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe
me, nor hearken unto my voice for they will say, The LORD hath not
appeared unto thee.

 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
said, A rod.

 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a
rod in his hand  That they may believe that the LORD God of their
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
hath appeared unto thee.

 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into
thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it
out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his
hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,
behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
voice of the latter sign.

 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land and the water which
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but I
am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the
LORD?   Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach
thee what thou shalt say.

 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send.

 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.
And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth
thee, he will be glad in his heart.

 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth and I
will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
shall do.

 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be,
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
instead of God.

 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
do signs.

 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which
are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to
Moses, Go in peace.

 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt
for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,
and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in
his hand.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have
put in thine hand but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let
the people go.

 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is
my son, even my firstborn  And I say unto thee, Let my son go,
that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will
slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,
and sought to kill him.

 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art
thou to me.

 So he let him go then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
because of the circumcision.

 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,
and all the signs which he had commanded him.

 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
the children of Israel  And Aaron spake all the words which the
LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the
people.

 And the people believed and when they heard that the LORD had
visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilderness.

 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to
let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.

 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us let us go,
we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto
the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the
sword.

 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and
ye make them rest from their burdens.

 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
and their officers, saying,  Ye shall no more give the people straw
to make brick, as heretofore let them go and gather straw for
themselves.

 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be
idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
therein; and let them not regard vain words.

 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,
and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not
give you straw.

 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your
work shall be diminished.

 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
daily tasks, as when there was straw.

 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
day, as heretofore?   Then the officers of the children of Israel
came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with
thy servants?   There is no straw given unto thy servants, and
they say to us, Make brick and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but
the fault is in thine own people.

 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle therefore ye say, Let us
go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were
in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your
bricks of your daily task.

 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
forth from Pharaoh  And they said unto them, The LORD look upon
you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the
eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
their hand to slay us.

 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast
thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?
 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do
to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a
strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD 
And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name
of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them
the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
strangers.

 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I
will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will
rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched
out arm, and with great judgments  And I will take you to me for a
people, and I will be to you a God and ye shall know that I am the
LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians.

 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give
it you for an heritage I am the LORD.

 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel but they hearkened
not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Go in, speak unto
Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of
his land.

 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of
Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who
am of uncircumcised lips?   And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto
Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto
Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land
of Egypt.

 These be the heads of their fathers' houses The sons of Reuben
the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi these
be the families of Reuben.

 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman these are the
families of Simeon.

 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari and the years of the
life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
families.

 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel
and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three
years.

 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi these are the families
of Levi according to their generations.

 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she
bare him Aaron and Moses and the years of the life of Amram were an
hundred and thirty and seven years.

 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
Ithamar.

 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph these
are the families of the Korhites.

 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel
to wife; and she bare him Phinehas these are the heads of the fathers
of the Levites according to their families.

 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out
the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their
armies.

 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out
the children of Israel from Egypt these are that Moses and Aaron.

 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in
the land of Egypt,  That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am
the LORD speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto
thee.

 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?   And the LORD said
unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy
brother shall be thy prophet.

 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee and Aaron thy brother
shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of
his land.

 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
wonders in the land of Egypt.

 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch
forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from
among them.

 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.

 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  When
Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you then
thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,
and it shall become a serpent.

 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
LORD had commanded and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and
before his servants, and it became a serpent.

 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the
magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
enchantments.

 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents
but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;
as the LORD had said.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
refuseth to let the people go.

 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and
the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in
the wilderness and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD
behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
river.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of
water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
vessels of stone.

 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted
up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight
of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that
were in the river were turned to blood.

 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was
blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments and
Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
LORD had said.

 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
his heart to this also.

 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
the river.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
borders with frogs  And the river shall bring forth frogs
abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy
bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and
upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs
 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
upon all thy servants.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the
ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
frogs upon the land of Egypt.

 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and
I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.

 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me when shall I intreat
for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the
frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river
only?   And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to
thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD
our God.

 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river
only.

 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh and Moses cried unto
the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

 And they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank.

 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
throughout all the land of Egypt.

 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in
beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of
Egypt.

 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
lice, but they could not so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God
and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as
the LORD had said.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto
him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,
and into thy houses and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou
mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.

 And I will put a division between my people and thy people to
morrow shall this sign be.

 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all
the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of
flies.

 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
sacrifice to your God in the land.

 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice
the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God lo, shall we
sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will
they not stone us?   We will go three days' journey into the
wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away
intreat for me.

 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
servants, and from his people, to morrow but let not Pharaoh deal
deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
LORD.

 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed
the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his
people; there remained not one.

 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would
he let the people go.

 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they
may serve me.

 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 
Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,
upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and
upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain.

 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
cattle of Egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the
children's of Israel.

 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
shall do this thing in the land.

 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
Egypt died but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of
the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did
not let the people go.

 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls
of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven
in the sight of Pharaoh.

 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall
be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,
throughout all the land of Egypt.

 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking
forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
Egyptians.

 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the
Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
there is none like me in all the earth.

 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all
the earth.

 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
not let them go?   Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause
it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since
the foundation thereof even until now.

 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast
in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
them, and they shall die.

 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses  And he
that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his
cattle in the field.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
Egypt.

 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the LORD
sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the
LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it
became a nation.

 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was
in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
field, and brake every tree of the field.

 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
was there no hail.

 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
them, I have sinned this time the LORD is righteous, and I and my
people are wicked.

 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no
longer.

 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall
cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how
that the earth is the LORD's.

 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
fear the LORD God.

 And the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in
the ear, and the flax was bolled.

 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not
grown up.

 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
his hands unto the LORD and the thunders and hail ceased, and the
rain was not poured upon the earth.

 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his
servants.

 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh for I have
hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew
these my signs before him  And that thou mayest tell in the ears
of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,
and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I
am the LORD.

 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will
I bring the locusts into thy coast  And they shall cover the face
of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall
eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you
from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of
the field  And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all
thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy
fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they
were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out
from Pharaoh.

 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be
a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their
God knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?   And Moses and
Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh and he said unto them, Go,
serve the LORD your God but who are they that shall go?   And
Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons
and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;
for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
let you go, and your little ones look to it; for evil is before you.

 Not so go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye
did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of
Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath
left.

 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
all the coasts of Egypt very grievous were they; before them there
were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the
fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any
green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all
the land of Egypt.

 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death
only.

 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one
locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
the children of Israel go.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even
darkness which may be felt.

 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was
a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days  They saw
not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days but
all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;
only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones
also go with you.

 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and
we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them
go.

 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou
shalt die.

 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again
no more.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence
when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence
altogether.

 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of
his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and
jewels of gold.

 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
Egyptians.

Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out
into the midst of Egypt  And all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his
throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the
mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
his tongue, against man or beast that ye may know how that the LORD
doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that
follow thee and after that I will go out. And he went out from
Pharaoh in a great anger.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh and
the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
children of Israel go out of his land.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
saying,  This month shall be unto you the beginning of months it
shall be the first month of the year to you.

 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,
according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house  And
if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour
next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;
every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year ye
shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats  And ye shall
keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole
assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side
posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat
it.

 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with
fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on
your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste
it is the LORD's passover.

 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and
against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the LORD.

 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where
ye are and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep
it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a
feast by an ordinance for ever.

 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth
leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul
shall be cut off from Israel.

 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in
the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner
of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,
that only may be done of you.

 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt
therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an
ordinance for ever.

 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,
ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even.

 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for
whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut
off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born
in the land.

 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye
eat unleavened bread.

 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and
kill the passover.

 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts
with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at
the door of his house until the morning.

 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when
he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the
LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to
come in unto your houses to smite you.

 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to
thy sons for ever.

 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
this service.

 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
you, What mean ye by this service?   That ye shall say, It is the
sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the
children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and
delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.

 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat
on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the
dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and
all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was
not a house where there was not one dead.

 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of
Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
gone; and bless me also.

 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of
gold, and raiment  And the LORD gave the people favour in the
sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as
they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
herds, even very much cattle.

 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust
out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for
themselves any victual.

 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of
the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
them out from the land of Egypt this is that night of the LORD to be
observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of
the passover There shall no stranger eat thereof  But every
man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised
him, then shall he eat thereof.

 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought
of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone
thereof.

 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the
land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger
that sojourneth among you.

 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses
and Aaron, so did they.

 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Sanctify unto me all
the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of
Israel, both of man and of beast it is mine.

 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of
hand the LORD brought you out from this place there shall no leavened
bread be eaten.

 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,
and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a
land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in
this month.

 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
day shall be a feast to the LORD.

 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen
with thee in all thy quarters.

 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of
Egypt.

 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth
for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.

 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year
to year.

 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall
give it thee,  That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that
openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which
thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and
if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck and all
the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of
hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage
 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the
firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast therefore I sacrifice to
the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the
firstborn of my children I redeem.

 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
between thine eyes for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth
out of Egypt.

 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,
although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people
repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt  But God led
the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea
and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for he had straitly
sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and
ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,
in the edge of the wilderness.

 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to
lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them
light; to go by day and night  He took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the
people.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,
between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon before it shall
ye encamp by the sea.

 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that
the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled and the
heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,
and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from
serving us?   And he made ready his chariot, and took his people
with him  And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the
chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went
out with an high hand.

 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots
of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them
encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they
were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.

 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?   Is not this
the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we
may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the
Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day for
the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no
more for ever.

 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward  But
lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and
divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through
the midst of the sea.

 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
they shall follow them and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and
upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
horsemen.

 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from
before their face, and stood behind them  And it came between
the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud
and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these so that the
one came not near the other all the night.

 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and
made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right
hand, and on their left.

 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the
cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,  And took off
their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily so that the
Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD
fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their
chariots, and upon their horsemen.

 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians
fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
the sea.

 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after
them; there remained not so much as one of them.

 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of
the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and
on their left.

 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
Egyptians and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and
his servant Moses.

 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.

 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation
he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,
and I will exalt him.

 The LORD is a man of war the LORD is his name.

 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his
chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

 The depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a
stone.

 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power thy right
hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath, which
consumed them as stubble.

 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were
congealed in the heart of the sea.

 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
hand shall destroy them.

 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them they sank
as lead in the mighty waters.

 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?   Thou
stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation.

 The people shall hear, and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on
the inhabitants of Palestina.

 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
shall melt away.

 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O
LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee
to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have
established.

 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the
sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the
midst of the sea.

 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and
with dances.

 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.

 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into
the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,
and found no water.

 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters
of Marah, for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called
Marah.

 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
drink?   And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a
tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he
proved them,  And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the
voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his
sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have
brought upon the Egyptians for I am the LORD that healeth thee.

 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters.

 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is
between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after
their departing out of the land of Egypt.

 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness  And the children of
Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the
LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we
did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this
wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate
every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or
no.

 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as
they gather daily.

 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the
land of Egypt  And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of
the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD and
what are we, that ye murmur against us?   And Moses said, This
shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,
and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your
murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we? your
murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.

 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
children of Israel, Come near before the LORD for he hath heard your
murmurings.

 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,
and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  I have heard the
murmurings of the children of Israel speak unto them, saying, At even
ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;
and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.

 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of
the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar
frost on the ground.

 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
another, It is manna for they wist not what it was. And Moses said
unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.

 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to
the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in
his tents.

 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
less.

 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they
gathered every man according to his eating.

 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them
left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank and Moses
was wroth with them.

 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
eating and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
as much bread, two omers for one man and all the rulers of the
congregation came and told Moses.

 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To
morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD bake that which
ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade and it did
not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
the LORD to day ye shall not find it in the field.

 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws?   See, for that the LORD hath given you
the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two
days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place
on the seventh day.

 So the people rested on the seventh day.

 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna and it
was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers
made with honey.

 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see
the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought
you forth from the land of Egypt.

 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your
generations.

 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
Testimony, to be kept.

 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the
borders of the land of Canaan.

 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the
commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim and there was no
water for the people to drink.

 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with
me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?   And the people thirsted
there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,
Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill
us and our children and our cattle with thirst?   And Moses cried
unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be
almost ready to stone me.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take
with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest
the river, take in thine hand, and go.

 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,
that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders
of Israel.

 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because
of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the
LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?   Then came Amalek,
and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight
with Amalek to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the
rod of God in mine hand.

 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek
and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
prevailed and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,
the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his
hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
Jehovahnissi  For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the
LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of
all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that
the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;  Then Jethro, Moses'
father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for
he said, I have been an alien in a strange land  And the name of
the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine
help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh  And Jethro,
Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into
the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God  And he
said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy
wife, and her two sons with her.

 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,
and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they
came into the tent.

 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto
Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail
that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.

 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done
to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out
of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods for in the
thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
sacrifices for God and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to
eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
people and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the
evening.

 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,
he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest
thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto
even?   And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people
come unto me to enquire of God  When they have a matter, they
come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them
know the statutes of God, and his laws.

 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
doest is not good.

 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
perform it thyself alone.

 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
shall be with thee Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou
mayest bring the causes unto God  And thou shalt teach them
ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must
walk, and the work that they must do.

 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such
as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over
them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of
fifties, and rulers of tens  And let them judge the people at
all seasons and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring
unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be
easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their
place in peace.

 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
all that he had said.

 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of
fifties, and rulers of tens.

 And they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they
brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into
his own land.

 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth
out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness
of Sinai.

 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert
of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped
before the mount.

 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of
the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and
tell the children of Israel;  Ye have seen what I did unto the
Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto
myself.

 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
people for all the earth is mine  And ye shall be unto me a
kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of
Israel.

 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.

 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD
hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people
unto the LORD.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe
thee for ever.

And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,  And
be ready against the third day for the third day the LORD will come
down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch
the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to
death  There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not
live when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day
come not at your wives.

 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there
were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and
the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that
was in the camp trembled.

 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
mount and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses
went up.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify
themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount
Sinai for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and
sanctify it.

 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt
come up, thou, and Aaron with thee but let not the priests and the
people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth
upon them.

 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

 And God spake all these words, saying,  I am the LORD thy
God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of bondage.

 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth.

 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them for I
the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me;  And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love
me, and keep my commandments.

 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work  But the
seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor
thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates  For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day wherefore the
LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

 Honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 Thou shalt not kill.

 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

 Thou shalt not steal.

 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his
ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and
the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking and when the
people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear
but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not for God is come to
prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin
not.

 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
thick darkness where God was.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from
heaven.

 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make
unto you gods of gold.

 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and
thine oxen in all places where I record my name I will come unto
thee, and I will bless thee.

 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build
it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast
polluted it.

 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
nakedness be not discovered thereon.

 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve and in
the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself if he were
married, then his wife shall go out with him.

 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons
or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he
shall go out by himself.

 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,
and my children; I will not go out free  Then his master shall
bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or
unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an
aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not
go out as the menservants do.

 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,
then shall he let her be redeemed to sell her unto a strange nation
he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her
after the manner of daughters.

 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty
of marriage, shall he not diminish.

 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
free without money.

 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
death.

 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;

him be quit only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall
cause him to be thoroughly healed.

 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's
tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die then the ox shall
be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of
the ox shall be quit.

 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and
it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but
that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his
owner also shall be put to death.

 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

stoned.

not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;  The owner of the
pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the
dead beast shall be his.

 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall
sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also
they shall divide.

 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and
the dead shall be his own.

 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;
he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,

brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his
neighbour's goods.

 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another
challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the
judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto
his neighbour.

 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,
no man seeing it  Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them
both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and
the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.

owner thereof.

he shall not make good that which was torn.

 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or

 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I
will surely hear their cry;  And my wrath shall wax hot, and I
will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your
children fatherless.

 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him
usury.

 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down  For that
is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin wherein shall he
sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will
hear; for I am gracious.

 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
people.

 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and
of thy liquors the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep
seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give
it me.

that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

surely bring it back to him again.

burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with
him.

slay thou not for I will not justify the wicked.

 And thou shalt take no gift for the gift blindeth the wise, and
perverteth the words of the righteous.

 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger for ye know the heart of
a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
fruits thereof  But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and
lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat and what they leave
the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with
thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
shalt rest that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy
handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect and
make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out
of thy mouth.

 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread (thou shalt eat
unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt and
none shall appear before me empty)  And the feast of harvest,
the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field and
the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou
hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.

 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the
LORD God.

 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother's milk.

 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will
not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him.

 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary
unto thine adversaries.

 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,
the Hivites, and the Jebusites and I will cut them off.

 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite
break down their images.

 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of
thee.

 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
land the number of thy days I will fulfil.

 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people
to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their
backs unto thee.

 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the
land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against
thee.

 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of
the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river for I will
deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt
drive them out before thee.

 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
against me for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare
unto thee.

 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron,
Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye
afar off.

 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD but they shall not come
nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and
all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice, and
said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.

 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in
the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.

 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half
of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of
the people and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and
be obedient.

 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with
you concerning all these words.

 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of
the elders of Israel  And they saw the God of Israel and there
was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as
it were the body of heaven in his clearness.

 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
hand also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and
be there and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua and Moses went up
into the mount of God.

 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come
again unto you and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you if any man
have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud
covered it six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of
the midst of the cloud.

 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into
the mount and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, that they bring me an offering of every man that
giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.

 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and

purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names
of the children of Israel  Six of their names on one stone, and
the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their
birth.

 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a
signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the
children of Israel thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.

 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel and Aaron

memorial.

 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;  And two chains of pure
gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten
the wreathen chains to the ouches.

 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of
blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt
thou make it.

 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length
thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

stones the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle

 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
diamond.

Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a
signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve
tribes.

 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
wreathen work of pure gold.

 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and
shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
ephod before it.

 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is
in the side of the ephod inward.

 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them
on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof,
over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of
the ephod.

 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the
curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed
from the ephod.

 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the
breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy
place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.

 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in
before the LORD and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of
Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.

 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
thereof it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of
it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.

 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and
bells of gold between them round about  A golden bell and a
pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe
round about.

 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister and his sound shall be
heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when
he cometh out, that he die not.

 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow
in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead,
that they may be accepted before the LORD.

 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt
make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of
needlework.

 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make
for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and
for beauty.

 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify
them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach 
And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in
unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto
the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity,
and die it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after
him.

 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
them, to minister unto me in the priest's office Take one young
bullock, and two rams without blemish,  And unleavened bread, and
cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed
with oil of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.

 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.

 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and
gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod  And thou shalt put
the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.

 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
head, and anoint him.

 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
put the bonnets on them and the priest's office shall be theirs for a
perpetual statute and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.

 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
tabernacle of the congregation and Aaron and his sons shall put their
hands upon the head of the bullock.

 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.

 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon
the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside
the bottom of the altar.

 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt
thou burn with fire without the camp it is a sin offering.

 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
their hands upon the head of the ram.

 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and
sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.

 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar it is a burnt
offering unto the LORD it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire
unto the LORD.

 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall
put their hands upon the head of the ram.

 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it
upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right
ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the
great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar
round about.

 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of
the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,
and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him and he
shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'
garments with him.

 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the
two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder;
for it is a ram of consecration  And one loaf of bread, and one
cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened
bread that is before the LORD  And thou shalt put all in the
hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for
a wave offering before the LORD.

 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD it
is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD and it
shall be thy part.

 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the
shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved
up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,
and of that which is for his sons  And it shall be Aaron's and
his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel for it is
an heave offering and it shall be an heave offering from the children
of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
offering unto the LORD.

 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to
be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven
days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to
minister in the holy place.

 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his
flesh in the holy place.

 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
made, to consecrate and to sanctify them but a stranger shall not eat
thereof, because they are holy.

 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,
remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire
it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to
all things which I have commanded thee seven days shalt thou
consecrate them.

 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for
atonement and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an
atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy whatsoever toucheth
the altar shall be holy.

 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
lambs of the first year day by day continually.

 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb
thou shalt offer at even  And with the one lamb a tenth deal of
flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the
fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.

 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according
to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by
fire unto the LORD.

 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before
the LORD where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me
in the priest's office.

 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their
God.

 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them I am
the LORD their God.

 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon of shittim
wood shalt thou make it.

 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
thereof; foursquare shall it be and two cubits shall be the height
thereof the horns thereof shall be of the same.

 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt
make unto it a crown of gold round about.

 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,
by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make
it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
with gold.

 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I
will meet with thee.

 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he
dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense
upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your
generations.

 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,
nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a
year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements once in the
year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations it
is most holy unto the LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  When thou takest
the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they
give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou
numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou
numberest them.

 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are
numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel
is twenty gerahs) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.

 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty
years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make
an atonement for your souls.

 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel
before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Thou shalt also
make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal and
thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the
altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
thereat  When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,
they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near
to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD
 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
not and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to
his seed throughout their generations.

 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take thou also
unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of
sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and
of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,  And of cassia
five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil
olive an hin  And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an
ointment compound after the art of the apothecary it shall be an holy
anointing oil.

 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
therewith, and the ark of the testimony,  And the table and all
his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of
incense,  And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,
and the laver and his foot.

 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy
whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
any other like it, after the composition of it it is holy, and it
shall be holy unto you.

 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
frankincense of each shall there be a like weight  And thou
shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,
tempered together, pure and holy  And thou shalt beat some of it
very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of
the congregation, where I will meet with thee it shall be unto you
most holy.

 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make
to yourselves according to the composition thereof it shall be unto
thee holy for the LORD.

 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
even be cut off from his people.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  See, I have called by
name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah
 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
brass,  And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts of all that are wise
hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have
commanded thee;  The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark
of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
furniture of the tabernacle,  And the table and his furniture, and
the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,
 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the
laver and his foot,  And the cloths of service, and the holy
garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to
minister in the priest's office,  And the anointing oil, and
sweet incense for the holy place according to all that I have
commanded thee shall they do.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak thou also
unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep
for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that
ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.

 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you
every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever
doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his
people.

 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of
rest, holy to the LORD whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,
he shall surely be put to death.

 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual
covenant.

 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever for
in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he
rested, and was refreshed.

 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,
written with the finger of God.

 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and
said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for
this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we
wot not what is become of him.

 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,
and bring them unto me.

 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf and they said, These
be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat
and to drink, and rose up to play.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,
which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted
themselves  They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
commanded them they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped
it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O
Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
behold, it is a stiffnecked people  Now therefore let me alone,
that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them
and I will make of thee a great nation.

 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth
out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did
he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them
from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of
this evil against thy people.

 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your
seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of
will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.

 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
his people.

 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on
both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
writing of God, graven upon the tables.

 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the
noise of them that sing do I hear.

 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that
he saw the calf, and the dancing and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he
cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made
the children of Israel drink of it.

 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that
thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?   And Aaron said, Let
not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people, that they
are set on mischief.

 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us
for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
off. So they gave it me then I cast it into the fire, and there came
out this calf.

 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
made them naked unto their shame among their enemies)  Then
Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's
side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered
themselves together unto him.

 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate
throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his
companion, and every man his neighbour.

 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and
there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow
upon you a blessing this day.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
people, Ye have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the
LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have
sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,
I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,
him will I blot out of my book.

 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have
spoken unto thee behold, mine Angel shall go before thee
nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
which Aaron made.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto
the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,
Unto thy seed will I give it  And I will send an angel before
thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the
Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite  Unto a
land flowing with milk and honey for I will not go up in the midst of
thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people lest I consume thee in the
way.

 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned and
no man did put on him his ornaments.

 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people I will come up into the midst of
thee in a moment, and consume thee therefore now put off thy
ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.

 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
by the mount Horeb.

 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,
afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the
congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the
LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was
without the camp.

 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and
looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and
the Lord talked with Moses.

 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
door and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent
door.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp but his servant
Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the
tabernacle.

 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with
me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found
grace in my sight.

 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,
shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in
thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people.

 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
thee rest.

 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
not up hence.

 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so
shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are
upon the face of the earth.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know
thee by name.

 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I
will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew
mercy.

 And he said, Thou canst not see my face for there shall no man
see me, and live.

 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
shalt stand upon a rock  And it shall come to pass, while my
glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and
will cover thee with my hand while I pass by  And I will take
away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall
not be seen.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were
in the first tables, which thou brakest.

 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before
that mount.

 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses
rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the
LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The
LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth,  Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear
the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,
and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth
generation.

 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
worshipped.

 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let
my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and
pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant before all thy people I
will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in
any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work
of the LORD for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

 Observe thou that which I command thee this day behold, I drive
out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and
the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in
the midst of thee  But ye shall destroy their altars, break
their images, and cut down their groves  For thou shalt worship
no other god for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God
 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and
they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,
and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;  And thou take
of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring
after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.

 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the
month Abib for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and
if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before
me empty.

 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of
wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the
LORD God, the God of Israel.

 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
borders neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up
to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.

 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto
the morning.

 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother's milk.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words for after
the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with
Israel.

 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables
the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with
the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the
mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
talked with him.

 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,
the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him and Moses talked with them.

 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave
them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount
Sinai.

 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his
face.

 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto
the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin
of Moses' face shone and Moses put the vail upon his face again,
until he went in to speak with him.

 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath
commanded, that ye should do them.

 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD whosoever doeth
work therein shall be put to death.

 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
sabbath day.

 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,
 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD whosoever is of
a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and
silver, and brass,  And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
linen, and goats' hair,  And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers'
skins, and shittim wood,  And oil for the light, and spices for
anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,  And onyx stones, and
stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
the LORD hath commanded;  The tabernacle, his tent, and his
covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his
sockets,  The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat,
and the vail of the covering,  The table, and his staves, and all
his vessels, and the shewbread,  The candlestick also for the
light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,
 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in
of the tabernacle,  The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen
grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 
The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the
hanging for the door of the court,  The pins of the tabernacle,
and the pins of the court, and their cords,  The cloths of
service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron
the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's
office.

 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from
the presence of Moses.

 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering
to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his
service, and for the holy garments.

 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,
all jewels of gold and every man that offered offered an offering of
gold unto the LORD.

 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and
badgers' skins, brought them.

 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought
the LORD's offering and every man, with whom was found shittim wood
for any work of the service, brought it.

 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of
purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
goats' hair.

 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
the ephod, and for the breastplate;  And spice, and oil for the
light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD,
every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all
manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of
Moses.

 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe
of Judah;  And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in
wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
workmanship;  And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and
in silver, and in brass,  And in the cutting of stones, to set
them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of
work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the
embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,
and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that
devise cunning work.

 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in
whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all
manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that
the LORD had commanded.

 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose
heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it  And they
received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had
brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it
withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,
came every man from his work which they made;  And they spake unto
Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service
of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.

 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more
work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained
from bringing.

 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
it, and too much.

 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and
purple, and scarlet with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits the curtains were all of one size.

 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another and the other
five curtains he coupled one unto another.

 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
selvedge in the coupling likewise he made in the uttermost side of
another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second the
loops held one curtain to another.

 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
unto another with the taches so it became one tabernacle.

 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
tabernacle eleven curtains he made them.

 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was
the breadth of one curtain the eleven curtains were of one size.

 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
themselves.

 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain
which coupleth the second.

 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
that it might be one.

 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and
a covering of badgers' skins above that.

 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing
up.

 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board
one cubit and a half.

 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another thus
did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
south side southward  And forty sockets of silver he made under
the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
north corner, he made twenty boards,  And their forty sockets of

 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the

 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head
thereof, to one ring thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one
side of the tabernacle,  And five bars for the boards of the

 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the
one end to the other.

 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid

was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a
cubit and a half the height of it  And he overlaid it with pure
gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings

 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side out of
the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;
even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

 And he made the table of shittim wood two cubits was the length

height thereof  And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made
thereunto a crown of gold round about.

 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
staves to bear the table.

 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
gold, to bear the table.

 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,
for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron
the priest.

 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,
an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in
purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine
talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary.

 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore
and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary  A bekah
for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the
sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years
old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty men.

 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the
hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted

court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins
of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments
for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
fine twined linen.

 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet,
and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together by the
two edges was it coupled together.

 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the
same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven,
as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should
be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD
commanded Moses.

 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the
ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double a span was
the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

 And they set in it four rows of stones the first row was a
sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle this was the first row.

 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper they were
inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a
signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
wreathen work of pure gold.

 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on
the ends of the breastplate.

 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the
two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before
it.

 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of
the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the
ephod inward.

 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against
the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of
the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious
girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from
the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not
rend.

 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the
pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the
pomegranates;  A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a
pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the
LORD commanded Moses.

 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
for his sons,  And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of
fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,  And a
girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of
needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS
TO THE LORD.

 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon
the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
congregation finished and the children of Israel did according to all
that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and
his sockets,  And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the
covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,  The
ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,
 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 
The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to
be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,
 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,  The brasen
altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the
laver and his foot,  The hangings of the court, his pillars, and
his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his
pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the
tent of the congregation,  The cloths of service to do service in
the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his
sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.

 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children
of Israel made all the work.

 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done
it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it and Moses
blessed them.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  On the first day of
the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the
congregation.

 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
the ark with the vail.

 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the
candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the
ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the
tabernacle.

 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation
and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
hanging at the court gate.

 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,
and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels
thereof and it shall be holy.

 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
his vessels, and sanctify the altar and it shall be an altar most
holy.

 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,
and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats 
And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that
they may minister unto me in the priest's office for their anointing
shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their
generations.

 Thus did Moses according to all that the LORD commanded him, so
did he.

 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars.

 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark 
And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the
covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded
Moses.

 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
LORD had commanded Moses.

 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over
against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded
Moses.

 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
before the vail  And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD
commanded Moses.

 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the
burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
feet thereat  When they went into the tent of the congregation,
and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
commanded Moses.

 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the
work.

 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory
of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the
LORD filled the tabernacle.

 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
children of Israel went onward in all their journeys  But if the
cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it
was taken up.

 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,
throughout all their journeys.




The Third Book of Moses  Called Leviticus


 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
tabernacle of the congregation, saying,  Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto
the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the
herd, and of the flock.

 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a
male without blemish he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and
it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD and the priests,
Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round
about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,
and lay the wood in order upon the fire  And the priests, Aaron's
sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the
wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar  But his inwards
and his legs shall he wash in water and the priest shall burn all on
the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of
the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without
blemish.

 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
the LORD and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood
round about upon the altar.

 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat
and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire
which is upon the altar  But he shall wash the inwards and the
legs with water and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon
the altar it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young
pigeons.

 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his
head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung
out at the side of the altar  And he shall pluck away his crop
with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by
the place of the ashes  And he shall cleave it with the wings
thereof, but shall not divide it asunder and the priest shall burn it
upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire it is a burnt
sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and
put frankincense thereon  And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons
the priests and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour
thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD  And the
remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons' it is a
thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or
unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be
of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon it is a meat
offering.

 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it
shall be made of fine flour with oil.

 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
things unto the LORD and when it is presented unto the priest, he
shall bring it unto the altar.

 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar it is an offering made by
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and
his sons' it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made
by fire.

 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
made with leaven for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any
offering of the LORD made by fire.

 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto
the LORD but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to
be lacking from thy meat offering with all thine offerings thou shalt
offer salt.

 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green
ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon it
is a meat offering.

 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
thereof it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer
it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it
without blemish before the LORD.

 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill
it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and Aaron's sons
the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,  And the two
kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the
caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire it is an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without
blemish.

 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before
the LORD.

 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill
it before the tabernacle of the congregation and Aaron's sons shall
sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.

 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole
rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that
covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
take away.

 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar it is the food of
the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the
LORD.

 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before
the tabernacle of the congregation and the sons of Aaron shall
sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by
fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat
that is upon the inwards,  And the two kidneys, and the fat that
is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,
with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar it is the food of
the offering made by fire for a sweet savour all the fat is the
LORD's.

 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout
all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the children
of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any
of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to
be done, and shall do against any of them  If the priest that is
anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring
for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish
unto the LORD for a sin offering.

 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the
bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,
and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation  And the priest
shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven
times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.

 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the
altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of
the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the
bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the
sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that
is upon the inwards,  And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon
them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the
kidneys, it shall he take away,  As it was taken off from the
bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings and the priest shall burn
them upon the altar of the burnt offering.

 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,  Even the whole
bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,
where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire
where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done
somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things
which should not be done, and are guilty;  When the sin, which
they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall
offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle
of the congregation.

 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
head of the bullock before the LORD and the bullock shall be killed
before the LORD.

 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
blood to the tabernacle of the congregation  And the priest shall
dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times
before the LORD, even before the vail.

 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the
altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation.

 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
altar.

 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a
sin offering, so shall he do with this and the priest shall make an
atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn
him as he burned the first bullock it is a sin offering for the
congregation.

 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things
which should not be done, and is guilty;  Or if his sin, wherein
he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a
kid of the goats, a male without blemish  And he shall lay his
hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they
kill the burnt offering before the LORD it is a sin offering.

 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with
his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt
offering.

 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
sacrifice of peace offerings and the priest shall make an atonement
for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while
he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;  Or
if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge then he shall
bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for
his sin which he hath sinned.

 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,
and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall
pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.

 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken
away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall
burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the
priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
female without blemish.

 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt
offering.

 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with
his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar
 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the
priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made
by fire unto the LORD and the priest shall make an atonement for his
sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,
then he shall bear his iniquity.

 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of
an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of
unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall
be unclean, and guilty.

 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it
be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he
knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do
good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it
be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one
of these.

 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,
that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing  And he
shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he
hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,
for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him
concerning his sin.

 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a
burnt offering.

 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his
neck, but shall not divide it asunder  And he shall sprinkle of
the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest
of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar it is a
sin offering.

 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to
the manner and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth
part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil
upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon for it is a
sin offering.

 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take
his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,
according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD it is a sin
offering.

 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him
and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  If a soul commit a
trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;
then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without
blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,
after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the
priest and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist
it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with
thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest and the
priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance
wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.

 It is a trespass offering he hath certainly trespassed against
the LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  If a soul sin, and
commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that
which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken
away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;  Or have found
that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in
any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein  Then it shall
be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that
which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully
gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing
which he found,  Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he
shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part
more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day
of his trespass offering.

 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
offering, unto the priest  And the priest shall make an atonement
for him before the LORD and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of
all that he hath done in trespassing therein.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Command Aaron and his
sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering It is the burnt
offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the
morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the
fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall
put them beside the altar.

 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not
be put out and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and
lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the
fat of the peace offerings.

 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
out.

 And this is the law of the meat offering the sons of Aaron shall
offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is
upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.

 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat with
unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of
the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
offerings of the LORD made by fire every one that toucheth them shall
be holy.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  This is the offering
of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the
day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for
a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof
at night.

 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
shalt bring it in and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt
thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
offer it it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly
burnt.

 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt it
shall not be eaten.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron and
to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering In the place
where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed
before the LORD it is most holy.

 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it in the holy
place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy and when
there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt
wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken and
if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed
in water.

 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof it is most
holy.

 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,
shall be eaten it shall be burnt in the fire.

 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering it is most
holy.

 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
the trespass offering and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round
about upon the altar.

 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
fat that covereth the inwards,  And the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above
the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away  And the priest
shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the
LORD it is a trespass offering.

 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof it shall be eaten
in the holy place it is most holy.

 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering there is one
law for them the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have
it.

 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the
priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
hath offered.

 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that
is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's
that offereth it.

 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
shall offer unto the LORD.

 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and
unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of
fine flour, fried.

 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that
sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall
not leave any of it until the morning.

 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
sacrifice and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten
 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
shall be burnt with fire.

 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither
shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it it shall be an
abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;
it shall be burnt with fire and as for the flesh, all that be clean
shall eat thereof.

 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon
him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his
people.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or
of sheep, or of goat.

 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use but ye
shall in no wise eat of it.

 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it
shall be cut off from his people.

 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl
or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that
soul shall be cut off from his people.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his
peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD
of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be
waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar but the breast
shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.

 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a
statute for ever from among the children of Israel.

 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the
priest's office;  Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the
children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
ever throughout their generations.

 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and
of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;  Which
the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded
the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the
wilderness of Sinai.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take Aaron and his sons
with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for
the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 
And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the
LORD commanded to be done.

 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded
him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him
therewith.

 And he put the breastplate upon him also he put in the
breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon
his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the
LORD commanded Moses.

 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
all that was therein, and sanctified them.

 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to
sanctify them.

 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
anointed him, to sanctify him.

 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD
commanded Moses.

 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering and Aaron and
his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin
offering.

 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the
altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified
it, to make reconciliation upon it.

 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul
above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned
it upon the altar.

 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering and Aaron and his
sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
round about.

 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
pieces, and the fat.

 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt
the whole ram upon the altar it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet
savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD
commanded Moses.

 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration and Aaron
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right
hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the
tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and
upon the great toes of their right feet and Moses sprinkled the blood
upon the altar round about.

 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon
the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and
their fat, and the right shoulder  And out of the basket of
unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened
cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the
fat, and upon the right shoulder  And he put all upon Aaron's
hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering
before the LORD.

 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the
altar upon the burnt offering they were consecrations for a sweet
savour it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
before the LORD for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as
the LORD commanded Moses.

 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was
upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,
and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and
sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'
garments with him.

 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and there eat it with the
bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,
Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
burn with fire.

 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at
an end for seven days shall he consecrate you.

 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
make an atonement for you.

 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the
LORD, that ye die not for so I am commanded.

 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by
the hand of Moses.

 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and
his sons, and the elders of Israel;  And he said unto Aaron, Take
thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,
without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.

 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye
a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of
the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;  Also a
bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;
and a meat offering mingled with oil for to day the LORD will appear
unto you.

 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle
of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood
before the LORD.

 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye
should do and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.

 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,
and for the people and offer the offering of the people, and make an
atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
offering, which was for himself.

 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped
his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and
poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar  But the fat, and
the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he
burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.

 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
thereof, and the head and he burnt them upon the altar.

 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
burnt offering on the altar.

 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for
sin, as the first.

 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
the manner.

 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
morning.

 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
offerings, which was for the people and Aaron's sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,  And
the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which
covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver
 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon
the altar  And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for
a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,
and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt
offering, and peace offerings.

 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and came out, and blessed the people and the glory of the LORD
appeared unto all the people.

 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon
the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people
saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his
censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered
strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.

 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
they died before the LORD.

 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all
the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren
from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
camp; as Moses had said.

 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,
and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren, the
whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.

 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon
you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,  Do not drink wine nor
strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the
tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die it shall be a statute for
ever throughout your generations  And that ye may put difference
between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;  And that
ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD
hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the
offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside
the altar for it is most holy  And ye shall eat it in the holy
place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of
the LORD made by fire for so I am commanded.

 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee for they be
thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of Israel.

 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering
before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a
statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
behold, it was burnt and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the
sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,  Wherefore have ye
not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,
and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to
make atonement for them before the LORD?   Behold, the blood of
it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have
eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.

 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such
things have befallen me and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,
should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?   And when
Moses heard that, he was content.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts
which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or
of them that divide the hoof as the camel, because he cheweth the
cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
hoof; he is unclean unto you.

 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
hoof; he is unclean unto you.

 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
touch; they are unclean to you.

 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters whatsoever hath
fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them
shall ye eat.

 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which
is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you  They
shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their
flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be
an abomination unto you.

 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination the eagle,
and the ossifrage, and the ospray,  And the vulture, and the kite
after his kind;  Every raven after his kind;  And the owl,
and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 
And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,  And
the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,  And the stork,
the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
abomination unto you.

 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon
the earth;  Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his
kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his
kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
shall be an abomination unto you.

 And for these ye shall be unclean whosoever toucheth the
carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you every one
that toucheth them shall be unclean.

 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
that go on all four, those are unclean unto you whoso toucheth their
carcase shall be unclean until the even.

 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even they are unclean unto you.

 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise
after his kind,  And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the
lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

 These are unclean to you among all that creep whosoever doth
touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,
it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or
skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it
must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it
shall be cleansed.

 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
shall be unclean and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel
shall be unclean.

 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall
be broken down for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.

 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
water, shall be clean but that which toucheth their carcase shall be
unclean.

 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which
is to be sown, it shall be clean.

 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even he also that beareth the carcase of it
shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that
creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an
abomination.

 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,
that ye should be defiled thereby.

 For I am the LORD your God ye shall therefore sanctify
yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy neither shall ye
defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth.

 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,
to be your God ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that
creepeth upon the earth  To make a difference between the
unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the
beast that may not be eaten.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a
man child then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days
of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
circumcised.

 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three
and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
weeks, as in her separation and she shall continue in the blood of
her purifying threescore and six days.

 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or
for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest
 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is
the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the
other for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for
her, and she shall be clean.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,  When a man
shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,
and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he
shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the
priests  And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of
the flesh and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the
plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague
of leprosy and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him
unclean.

 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned
white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven
days  And the priest shall look on him the seventh day and,
behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more
 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and,
behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in
the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean it is but a scab and
he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of
the priest again.

 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a leprosy.

 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought
unto the priest;  And the priest shall see him and, behold, if
the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,
and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;  It is an old leprosy
in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,
and shall not shut him up for he is unclean.

 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to
his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;  Then the priest shall
consider and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he
shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague it is all turned
white he is clean.

 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
unclean for the raw flesh is unclean it is a leprosy.

 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
shall come unto the priest;  And the priest shall see him and,
behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall
pronounce him clean that hath the plague he is clean.

 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,
and is healed,  And in the place of the boil there be a white
rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be
shewed to the priest;  And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,
it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned
white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a plague of
leprosy broken out of the boil.

 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat
dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days  And if it
spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean it is a plague.

 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is
a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,
somewhat reddish, or white;  Then the priest shall look upon it
and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be
in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the
burning wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is the
plague of leprosy.

 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but
be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days 
And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day and if it be
spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean it is the plague of leprosy.

 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the
skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the
priest shall pronounce him clean for it is an inflammation of the
burning.

 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
 Then the priest shall see the plague and, behold, if it be in
sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;
then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a dry scall, even a
leprosy upon the head or beard.

 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,
it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black
hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of
the scall seven days  And in the seventh day the priest shall
look on the plague and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be
in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
skin;  He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and
the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more
 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall and,
behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper
than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean.

 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
 Then the priest shall look on him and, behold, if the scall be
spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is
unclean.

 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean and the
priest shall pronounce him clean.

 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright
spots, even white bright spots;  Then the priest shall look and,
behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish
white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
is he clean.

 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
toward his face, he is forehead bald yet is he clean.

 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald
forehead.

 Then the priest shall look upon it and, behold, if the rising
of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;  He
is a leprous man, he is unclean the priest shall pronounce him
utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,
and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and
shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
defiled; he is unclean he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall
his habitation be.

 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be
a woollen garment, or a linen garment;  Whether it be in the
warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any
thing made of skin;  And if the plague be greenish or reddish in
the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in
any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
the priest  And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut
up it that hath the plague seven days  And he shall look on the
plague on the seventh day if the plague be spread in the garment,
either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that
is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is for
it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any
thing of skin;  Then the priest shall command that they wash the
thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more
 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
washed and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and
the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the
fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark
after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or
out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof  And if
it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague thou shalt burn that
wherein the plague is with fire.

 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from
them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen
or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to
pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  This shall be the law
of the leper in the day of his cleansing He shall be brought unto the
priest  And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the
priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
the leper;  Then shall the priest command to take for him that is
to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,
and hyssop  And the priest shall command that one of the birds be
killed in an earthen vessel over running water  As for the living
bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the
hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the
bird that was killed over the running water  And he shall
sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,
and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose
into the open field.

 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave
off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean and
after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of
his tent seven days.

 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his
hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he
shall shave off and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his
flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three
tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and
one log of oil.

 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that
is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation  And the priest shall take
one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of
oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD  And he
shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering
and the burnt offering, in the holy place for as the sin offering is
the priest's, so is the trespass offering it is most holy  And
the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and
the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
great toe of his right foot  And the priest shall take some of
the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand 
And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times
before the LORD  And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand
shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great
toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering 
And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour
upon the head of him that is to be cleansed and the priest shall make
an atonement for him before the LORD.

 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and
afterward he shall kill the burnt offering  And the priest shall
offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar and the
priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for
him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering, and a log of oil;  And two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin
offering, and the other a burnt offering.

 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto
the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
before the LORD.

 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and
the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering
before the LORD  And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass
offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great
toe of his right foot  And the priest shall pour of the oil into
the palm of his own left hand  And the priest shall sprinkle
with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven
times before the LORD  And the priest shall put of the oil that
is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe
of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
offering  And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand
he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
atonement for him before the LORD.

 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
pigeons, such as he can get;  Even such as he is able to get, the
one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the
meat offering and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is
to be cleansed before the LORD.

 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  When
ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a
possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of
your possession;  And he that owneth the house shall come and
tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague
in the house  Then the priest shall command that they empty the
house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
is in the house be not made unclean and afterward the priest shall go
in to see the house  And he shall look on the plague, and,
behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow
strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;
 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
house, and shut up the house seven days  And the priest shall
come again the seventh day, and shall look and, behold, if the plague
be spread in the walls of the house;  Then the priest shall
command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and
they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city  And
he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they
shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an
unclean place  And they shall take other stones, and put them in
the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
plaister the house.

 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after
that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the
house, and after it is plaistered;  Then the priest shall come
and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a
fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry
them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
shut up shall be unclean until the even.

 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold,
the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was
plaistered then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because
the plague is healed.

 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
wood, and scarlet, and hyssop  And he shall kill the one of the
birds in an earthen vessel over running water  And he shall take
the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,
and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water,
and sprinkle the house seven times  And he shall cleanse the
house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with
the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and
with the scarlet  But he shall let go the living bird out of the
city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house and it
shall be clean.

 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,  And for
a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot  To teach when
it is unclean, and when it is clean this is the law of leprosy.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,  Speak
unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a
running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.

 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue whether his flesh
run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his
uncleanness.

 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean and
every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
unclean until the even.

 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then
he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
until the even.

 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall
be unclean.

 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
unclean until the even and he that beareth any of those things shall
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue,
shall be broken and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he
shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his
clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest 
And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
him before the LORD for his issue.

 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.

 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation,
they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the
even.

 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
blood, she shall be put apart seven days and whosoever toucheth her
shall be unclean until the even.

 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
unclean every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.

 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him,
he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall
be unclean.

 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as
the days of her separation she shall be unclean.

 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
unto her as the bed of her separation and whatsoever she sitteth upon
shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile
my tabernacle that is among them.

 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;  And of her that is
sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of
the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of
Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;  And the LORD
said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all
times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which
is upon the ark; that he die not for I will appear in the cloud upon
the mercy seat.

 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place with a young bullock
for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and
with the linen mitre shall he be attired these are holy garments;
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel
two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt
offering.

 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.

 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
and offer him for a sin offering.

 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and
to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his
house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for
himself  And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of
fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail  And he shall
put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the
incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he
die not  And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and
sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before
the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven
times.

 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as
he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat, and before the mercy seat  And he shall make an atonement
for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of
Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins and so
shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth
among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come
out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household,
and for all the congregation of Israel.

 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and
make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,
and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar
round about.

 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
children of Israel.

 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the
live goat  And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of
the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting
them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of
a fit man into the wilderness  And the goat shall bear upon him
all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go
the goat in the wilderness.

 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went
into the holy place, and shall leave them there  And he shall
wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments,
and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering
of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.

 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the
camp.

 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in
the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you that in the
seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your
souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country,
or a stranger that sojourneth among you  For on that day shall
the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be
clean from all your sins before the LORD.

 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
your souls, by a statute for ever.

 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead,
shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the
holy garments  And he shall make an atonement for the holy
sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for
the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.

 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.
And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron, and
unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them;
This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,  What man
soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb,
or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,  And
bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD;
blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man
shall be cut off from among his people  To the end that the
children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the
open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them
for peace offerings unto the LORD.

 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the
fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after
whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto
them throughout their generations.

 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that
offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,  And bringeth it not unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the
LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I
will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will
cut him off from among his people.

 For the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it
to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is
the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you
eat blood.

 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast
or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,
and cover it with dust.

 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life
thereof therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat
the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the
blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or
a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in
water, and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean.

 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear
his iniquity.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.

 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye
not do and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring
you, shall ye not do neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
therein I am the LORD your God.

 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments which if a
man do, he shall live in them I am the LORD.

 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to
uncover their nakedness I am the LORD.

 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
shalt thou not uncover she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her
nakedness.

 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover it is
thy father's nakedness.

 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad,
even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover for theirs is
thine own nakedness.

 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister she
is thy father's near kinswoman.

 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister for
she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
thou shalt not approach to his wife she is thine aunt.

 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law she
is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife it
is thy brother's nakedness.

 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near
kinswomen it is wickedness.

 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife,
to defile thyself with her.

 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God I am the LORD.

 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind it is
abomination.

 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
therewith neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down
thereto it is confusion.

 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things for in all
these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you  And
the land is defiled therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon
it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall
not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation,
nor any stranger that sojourneth among you  (For all these
abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and
the land is defiled;)  That the land spue not you out also, when
ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.

 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.

 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and
that ye defile not yourselves therein I am the LORD your God.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto all the
congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be
holy for I the LORD your God am holy.

 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my
sabbaths I am the LORD your God.

 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods I am
the LORD your God.

 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye
shall offer it at your own will.

 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow
and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the
fire.

 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
shall not be accepted.

 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD and that soul
shall be cut off from among his people.

 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly
reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings
of thy harvest.

 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and
stranger I am the LORD your God.

 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
another.

 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
profane the name of thy God I am the LORD.

 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him the wages
of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the
morning.

 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
the blind, but shalt fear thy God I am the LORD.

 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment thou shalt not
respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty
but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people
neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the
LORD.

 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart thou shalt in
any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children
of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself I am the
LORD.

 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender
with a diverse kind thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed
neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given
her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because
she was not free.

 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass
offering.

 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done
and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.

 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all
manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
uncircumcised three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you it
shall not be eaten of.

 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
praise the LORD withal.

 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it
may yield unto you the increase thereof I am the LORD your God.

 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood neither shall ye use
enchantment, nor observe times.

 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou
mar the corners of thy beard.

 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
print any marks upon you I am the LORD.

 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest
the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary I am the
LORD.

 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
wizards, to be defiled by them I am the LORD your God.

 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of
the old man, and fear thy God I am the LORD.

 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
vex him.

 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were
strangers in the land of Egypt I am the LORD your God.

 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
weight, or in measure.

 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall
ye have I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Egypt.

 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
judgments, and do them I am the LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Again, thou shalt say
to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel,
or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his
seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death the people of the
land shall stone him with stones.

 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech,
to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not
 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,
and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit
whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face
against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy for I am the LORD
your God.

 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them I am the LORD which
sanctify you.

 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
surely put to death he hath cursed his father or his mother; his
blood shall be upon him.

 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the
adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his
father's nakedness both of them shall surely be put to death; their
blood shall be upon them.

 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
surely be put to death they have wrought confusion; their blood shall
be upon them.

 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.

 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness they
shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no
wickedness among you.

 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death
and ye shall slay the beast.

 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast they shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.

 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the
sight of their people he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he
shall bear his iniquity.

 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she
hath uncovered the fountain of her blood and both of them shall be
cut off from among their people.

 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister,
nor of thy father's sister for he uncovereth his near kin they shall
bear their iniquity.

 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered
his uncle's nakedness they shall bear their sin; they shall die
childless.

 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
thing he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be
childless.

 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
and do them that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue
you not out.

 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast
out before you for they committed all these things, and therefore I
abhorred them.

 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and
honey I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other
people.

 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean and ye shall not make
your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living
thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as
unclean.

 And ye shall be holy unto me for I the LORD am holy, and have
severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
wizard, shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with
stones their blood shall be upon them.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of
Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead
among his people  But for his kin, that is near unto him, that
is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
daughter, and for his brother.

 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
people, to profane himself.

 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their
flesh.

 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
their God for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread
of their God, they do offer therefore they shall be holy.

 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither
shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto
his God.

 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of
thy God he shall be holy unto thee for I the LORD, which sanctify
you, am holy.

 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing
the whore, she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire.

 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on
the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 
Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
father, or for his mother;  Neither shall he go out of the
sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the
anointing oil of his God is upon him I am the LORD.

 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
shall he not take but he shall take a virgin of his own people to
wife.

 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people for I the
LORD do sanctify him.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron,
saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any
blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
approach a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any
thing superfluous,  Or a man that is brokenfooted, or
brokenhanded,  Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish
in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come
nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire he hath a
blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of
the holy.

 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries
for I the LORD do sanctify them.

 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the
children of Israel.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron and
to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the
children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those
things which they hallow unto me I am the LORD.

 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of
Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that
soul shall be cut off from my presence I am the LORD.

 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.
And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man
whose seed goeth from him;  Or whosoever toucheth any creeping
thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take
uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;  The soul which hath
touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the
holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward
eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not
eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for
it, and die therefore, if they profane it I the LORD do sanctify
them.

 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing a sojourner of
the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
it, and he that is born in his house they shall eat of his meat.

 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth,
she shall eat of her father's meat but there shall be no stranger eat
thereof.

 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest
with the holy thing.

 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;  Or suffer them to bear
the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things for I the
LORD do sanctify them.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron,
and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto
them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in
Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his
freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt
offering;  Ye shall offer at your own will a male without
blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer for it
shall not be acceptable for you.

 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep,
it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering
by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;
but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof
in your land.

 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your
God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and
blemishes be in them they shall not be accepted for you.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  When a bullock, or
a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days
under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be
accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
young both in one day.

 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
LORD, offer it at your own will.

 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
until the morrow I am the LORD.

 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them I am the
LORD.

 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
among the children of Israel I am the LORD which hallow you, 
That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God I am the
LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the
LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are
my feasts.

 Six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the sabbath
of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein it is the
sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which
ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
passover.

 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
unleavened bread unto the LORD seven days ye must eat unleavened
bread.

 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation ye shall do
no servile work therein.

 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven
days in the seventh day is an holy convocation ye shall do no
servile work therein.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land
which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye
shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the
priest  And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be
accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall
wave it.

 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a
sweet savour and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the
fourth part of an hin.

 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto
your God it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations
in all your dwellings.

 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven
sabbaths shall be complete  Even unto the morrow after the
seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new
meat offering unto the LORD.

 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with
leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of
the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams they shall be for
a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their
drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto
the LORD.

 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,
and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits
for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs they shall be
holy to the LORD for the priest.

 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
holy convocation unto you ye shall do no servile work therein it
shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your
generations.

 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither
shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest thou shalt leave them
unto the poor, and to the stranger I am the LORD your God.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of
the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,
an holy convocation.

 Ye shall do no servile work therein but ye shall offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Also on the tenth
day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall
be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and
offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 And ye shall do no work in that same day for it is a day of
atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.

 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,
the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

 Ye shall do no manner of work it shall be a statute for ever
throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
your souls in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto
even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month
shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.

 On the first day shall be an holy convocation ye shall do no
servile work therein.

 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
LORD on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye
shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD it is a solemn
assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be
holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a
burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings,
every thing upon his day  Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and
beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your
freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD
seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day
shall be a sabbath.

 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and
willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God
seven days.

 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
year.

It shall be a statute for ever in your generations ye shall celebrate
it in the seventh month.

 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
born shall dwell in booths  That your generations may know that
I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them
out of the land of Egypt I am the LORD your God.

 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the
LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Command the children
of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the
light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning
before the LORD continually it shall be a statute for ever in your
generations.

 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
LORD continually.

 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof
two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure
table before the LORD.

 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may
be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the
LORD.

 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting
covenant.

 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in
the holy place for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the
LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel and this son of the
Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord,
and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses (and his mother's name
was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan)  And
they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Bring forth him
that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay
their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be
put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him as
well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth
the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.

 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.

 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,
so shall it be done to him;  Breach for breach, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be
done to him again.

 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it and he that
killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
for one of your own country for I am the LORD your God.

 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with
stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,  Speak
unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the
land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the
LORD.

 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;  But in the
seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for
the LORD thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a
year of rest unto the land.

 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and
for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for
thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall
all the increase thereof be meat.

 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall
be unto thee forty and nine years.

 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be
a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,
and ye shall return every man unto his family.

 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow,
neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes
in it of thy vine undressed.

 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field.

 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
possession.

 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another 
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he
shall sell unto thee  According to the multitude of years thou
shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of
years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
thy Godfor I am the LORD your God.

 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,
and dwell therein in safety.

 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,
we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase  Then I will
command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring
forth fruit for three years.

 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until
the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old
store.

 The land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine, for
ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
redemption for the land.

 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold.

 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
redeem it;  Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and
restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
return unto his possession.

 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the
year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return
unto his possession.

 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may
he redeem it.

 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then
the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to
him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in
the jubile.

 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be
redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the
cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.

 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of
jubile for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their
possession among the children of Israel.

 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
for it is their perpetual possession.

 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
then thou shalt relieve him yea, though he be a stranger, or a
sojourner; that he may live with thee.

 Take thou no usury of him, or increase but fear thy God; that
thy brother may live with thee.

 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
victuals for increase.

 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return.

 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land
of Egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen.

 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
God.

 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy
bondmen and bondmaids.

 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among
you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,
which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession.

 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for
ever but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule
one over another with rigour.

 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or
sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family 
After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren
may redeem him  Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem
him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;
or if he be able, he may redeem himself.

 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale
shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of
an hired servant shall it be with him.

 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall
give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was
bought for.

 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then
he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give
him again the price of his redemption.

 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the
other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt I am the LORD
your God.

 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up
a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your
land, to bow down unto it for I am the LORD your God.

 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary I am the
LORD.

 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield
her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the
full, and dwell in your land safely.

 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
none shall make you afraid and I will rid evil beasts out of the
land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
by the sword.

 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before
you by the sword.

 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
the new.

 And I set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor
you.

 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be
my people.

 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the
bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
commandments;  And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your
soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,
but that ye break my covenant  I also will do this unto you; I
will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,
that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall
sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall
flee when none pursueth you.

 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will
punish you seven times more for your sins.

 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
heaven as iron, and your earth as brass  And your strength shall
be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase, neither
shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I
will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number;
and your high ways shall be desolate.

 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
walk contrary unto me;  Then will I also walk contrary unto you,
and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.

 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities,
I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into
the hand of the enemy.

 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread
again by weight and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
contrary unto me;  Then I will walk contrary unto you also in
fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
daughters shall ye eat.

 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul
shall abhor you.

 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

 And I will bring the land into desolation and your enemies
which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
sword after you and your land shall be desolate, and your cities
waste.

 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land
rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness
into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a
shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a
sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.

 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your
enemies.

 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
enemies shall eat you up.

 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers
shall they pine away with them.

 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and
that also they have walked contrary unto me;  And that I also
have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of
their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity  Then will I
remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and
also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the
land.

 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept
of the punishment of their iniquity because, even because they
despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,
I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them
utterly, and to break my covenant with them for I am the LORD their
God.

 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight
of the heathen, that I might be their God I am the LORD.

 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand
of Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a
singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.

 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels
of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
shekels.

 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then
thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female
ten shekels.

 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
shekels.

 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according
to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.

 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.

 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and
the exchange thereof shall be holy.

 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the
priest  And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or
bad as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
thereof unto thy estimation.

 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad as
the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and
it shall be his.

 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed
thereof an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of
silver.

 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
thy estimation it shall stand.

 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,
even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy
estimation.

 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
it, and it shall be assured to him.

 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the
priest's.

 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;  Then the
priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto
the year of the jubile and he shall give thine estimation in that
day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.

 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did
belong.

 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep it is
the LORD's.

 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it
thereto or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to
thy estimation.

 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field
of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is
most holy unto the LORD.

 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
but shall surely be put to death.

 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,
or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's it is holy unto the LORD.

 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
add thereto the fifth part thereof.

 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the
LORD.

 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he
change it and if he change it at all, then both it and the change
thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
the children of Israel in mount Sinai.




The Fourth Book of Moses  Called Numbers


 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month,
in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
saying,  Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the
number of their names, every male by their polls;  From twenty
years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel
thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.

 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head

names  And they assembled all the congregation together on the
first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after
their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number
of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.

 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
wilderness of Sinai.

and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;  Those that
were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty
thousand and five hundred.

 Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their
families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of

by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all
that were able to go forth to war in Israel;  Even all they that
were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty.

 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
numbered among them.

 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,  Only thou shalt
not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the
children of Israel  But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the
tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over
all things that belong to it they shall bear the tabernacle, and all
the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp
round about the tabernacle.

 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take
it down and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall
set it up and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by
his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their
hosts.

 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
children of Israel and the Levites shall keep the charge of the
tabernacle of testimony.

 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses, so did they.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  Every
man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with
the ensign of their father's house far off about the tabernacle of
the congregation shall they pitch.

 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of
the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies and
Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of
Judah.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
Issachar and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the
children of Issachar.

 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and
four thousand and four hundred.

 Then the tribe of Zebulun and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
captain of the children of Zebulun.

 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and
seven thousand and four hundred.

 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred,
throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
according to their armies and the captain of the children of Reuben
shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
and six thousand and five hundred.

 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon and
the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of
Zurishaddai.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
and nine thousand and three hundred.

 Then the tribe of Gad and the captain of the sons of Gad shall
be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty,
throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in the second rank.

 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp as they encamp, so
shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.

 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
according to their armies and the captain of the sons of Ephraim
shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
thousand and five hundred.

 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh and the captain of the
children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty
and two thousand and two hundred.

 Then the tribe of Benjamin and the captain of the sons of
Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty
and five thousand and four hundred.

 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies.
And they shall go forward in the third rank.

 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
their armies and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer
the son of Ammishaddai.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
and one thousand and five hundred.

Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
and three thousand and four hundred.

 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They shall go
hindmost with their standards.

 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by
the house of their fathers all those that were numbered of the camps
throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand
and five hundred and fifty.

 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel;
as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses so they pitched by their standards, and so they set
forward, every one after their families, according to the house of
their fathers.

 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that
the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn,
and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were
anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.

 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had
no children and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office
in the sight of Aaron their father.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Bring the tribe of Levi
near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister
unto him.

 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the
service of the tabernacle.

 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the
service of the tabernacle.

 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons they
are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on
their priest's office and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put
to death.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  And I, behold, I have
taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the
firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel
therefore the Levites shall be mine;  Because all the firstborn
are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and
beast mine shall they be I am the LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by

 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were

 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the
tabernacle southward.

 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the
Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the

wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.

 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the

before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses,
and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the
charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh
shall be put to death.

 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families,
all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two
thousand.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take
the number of their names.

 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of
all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the
Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children
of Israel.

 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn
among the children of Israel.

 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month
old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and
two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take the Levites
instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the
cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall
be mine I am the LORD.

 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel,
which are more than the Levites;  Thou shalt even take five
shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt
thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs)  And thou shalt
give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed,
unto Aaron and to his sons.

 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
above them that were redeemed by the Levites  Of the firstborn of
the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and
threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary 
And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to
his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded
Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  Take the
sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their
families, by the house of their fathers,  From thirty years old and
upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do
the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle
of the congregation, about the most holy things  And when the camp
setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take
down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it 
And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread
over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.

 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,
and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers
to cover withal and the continual bread shall be thereon  And
they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same
with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves
thereof.

 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of
the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all
the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it  And
they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of
badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the
staves thereof  And they shall take all the instruments of
ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a
cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
shall put them on a bar  And they shall take away the ashes from
the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon  And they shall put
upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it,
even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all
the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of
badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.

 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it but
they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are
the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily
meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
vessels thereof.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,  Cut ye
not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the
Levites  But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die,
when they approach unto the most holy things Aaron and his sons shall
go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden
 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,
lest they die.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take also the sum of
the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their
families;  From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old
shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve,
and for burdens  And they shall bear the curtains of the
tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and
the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the
hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,  And
the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of
the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about,
and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all
that is made for them so shall they serve.

 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service
of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
service and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
tabernacle of the congregation and their charge shall be under the
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
families, by the house of their fathers;  From thirty years old
and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one
that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of
the congregation.

 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the
tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
thereof,  And the pillars of the court round about, and their
sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
and with all their service and by name ye shall reckon the
instruments of the charge of their burden.

 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation,
under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house
of their fathers,  From thirty years old and upward even unto
fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the
work in the tabernacle of the congregation  And those that were
numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and
fifty.

 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the
commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout
their families, and by the house of their fathers,  From thirty
years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that
entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the
congregation,  Even those that were numbered of them, throughout
their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
six hundred and thirty.

 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the
commandment of the LORD.

 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, 
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one
that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the
congregation,  Even those that were numbered of them after their
families, were three thousand and two hundred.

 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the
LORD by the hand of Moses.

 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron
and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the
house of their fathers,  From thirty years old and upward even
unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the
ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
five hundred and fourscore,  According to the commandment of the
LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to
his service, and according to his burden thus were they numbered of
him, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Command the children of
Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that
hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead  Both male and
female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they
defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the
camp as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the children
of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit,
to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;  Then
they shall confess their sin which they have done and he shall
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it
the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath
trespassed.

 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto,
let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest;
beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made
for him.

 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

 And every man's hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man
giveth the priest, it shall be his.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and
commit a trespass against him,  And a man lie with her carnally,
and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she
be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken
with the manner;  And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he
be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled or if the spirit of
jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
defiled  Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and
he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of
barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense
thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial,
bringing iniquity to remembrance.

 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD
 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of
the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take,
and put it into the water  And the priest shall set the woman
before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of
memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering and the priest
shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse 
And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If
no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from
this bitter water that causeth the curse  But if thou hast gone
aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and
some man have lain with thee beside thine husband  Then the
priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest
shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among
thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to
swell;  And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot And the
woman shall say, Amen, amen.

 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall
blot them out with the bitter water  And he shall cause the woman
to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that
causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.

 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer
it upon the altar  And the priest shall take an handful of the
offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and
afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.

 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come
to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her
husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,
and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot
and the woman shall be a curse among her people.

 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be
free, and shall conceive seed.

 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another
instead of her husband, and is defiled;  Or when the spirit of
jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall
set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her
all this law.

 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
shall bear her iniquity.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the children
of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate
themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the
LORD  He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and
shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither
shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.

 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made
of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
come upon his head until the days be fulfilled, in the which he
separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the
locks of the hair of his head grow.

 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
come at no dead body.

 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die because the
consecration of his God is upon his head.

 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the
head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of
his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation  And the priest shall offer the one for a sin
offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement
for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head
that same day.

 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation,
and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but
the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.

 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation  And he shall offer his offering
unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a
burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for
a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 
And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with
oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings.

 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer
his sin offering, and his burnt offering  And he shall offer the
ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket
of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering,
and his drink offering.

 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of
the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
sacrifice of the peace offerings.

 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one
unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall
put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his
separation is shaven  And the priest shall wave them for a wave
offering before the LORD this is holy for the priest, with the wave
breast and heave shoulder and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand
shall get according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after
the law of his separation.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron and
unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of
Israel, saying unto them,  The LORD bless thee, and keep thee
 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee  The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
peace.

 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
will bless them.

 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the
instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and
had anointed them, and sanctified them;  That the princes of
Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of
the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered  And
they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and
twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox
and they brought them before the tabernacle.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take it of them, that
they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation;
and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to
his service.

 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
Levites.

 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
according to their service  And four wagons and eight oxen he gave
unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand
of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none because the service of
the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their
shoulders.

 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before
the altar.

the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl
of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them
full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering  One

 On the twelfth day Ahira the son of Enan, prince of the children
of Naphtali, offered  His offering was one silver charger, the
weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of
seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full
of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering  One golden

 This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was
anointed, by the princes of Israel twelve chargers of silver, twelve
silver bowls, twelve spoons of gold  Each charger of silver
weighing an hundred and thirty shekels, each bowl seventy all the
silver vessels weighed two thousand and four hundred shekels, after
the shekel of the sanctuary  The golden spoons were twelve, full
of incense, weighing ten shekels apiece, after the shekel of the
sanctuary all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty
shekels.

 All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the
rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat
offering and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.

 And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were
twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the
lambs of the first year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar,
after that it was anointed.

 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation
to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him
from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from
between the two cherubims and he spake unto him.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Aaron and
say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give
light over against the candlestick.

 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the
candlestick.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take the Levites from
among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.

 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them Sprinkle water
of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let
them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.

 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even
fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take
for a sin offering.

 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
of Israel together  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
LORD and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the
Levites  And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service
of the LORD.

 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for
the Levites.

 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
Israel and the Levites shall be mine.

 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer
them for an offering.

 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the
firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of
Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
children of Israel.

 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children
of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an
atonement for the children of Israel that there be no plague among
the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the
sanctuary.

 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of
Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded
Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.

 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and
Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an
atonement for them to cleanse them.

 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons as
the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto
them.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  This is it that
belongeth unto the Levites from twenty and five years old and upward
they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation  And from the age of fifty years they shall cease
waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more  But
shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt
thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of
Egypt, saying,  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover
at his appointed season.

 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in
his appointed season according to all the rites of it, and according
to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep
the passover.

 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
month at even in the wilderness of Sinai according to all that the
LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
man, that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came
before Moses and before Aaron on that day  And those men said unto
him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept
back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed
season among the children of Israel?   And Moses said unto them,
Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning
you.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity
shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar
off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone
of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep
it.

 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off
from among his people because he brought not the offering of the LORD
in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover,
and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do ye shall have one
ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the
land.

 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony and at even
there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
the morning.

 So it was alway the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
of fire by night.

 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after
that the children of Israel journeyed and in the place where the
cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,
and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched as long as the cloud
abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed
not.

 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,
and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
journeyed.

 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of
Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not but when it was taken
up, they journeyed.

 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at
the commandment of the LORD they journeyed they kept the charge of
the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Make thee two
trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the
journeying of the camps.

 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto
thee.

 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
shall go forward.

 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on
the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for
their journeys.

 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
generations.

 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye
shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved
from your enemies.

 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over
your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
that they may be to you for a memorial before your God I am the LORD
your God.

 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in
the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle
of the testimony.

 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children
of Judah according to their armies and over his host was Nahshon the
son of Amminadab.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
Eliab the son of Helon.

 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
their armies and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary and the
other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
forward according to their armies and over his host was Elishama the
son of Ammihud.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
Abidan the son of Gideoni.

 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,
which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts and
over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
Pagiel the son of Ocran.

 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
Ahira the son of Enan.

 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to
their armies, when they set forward.

 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the
LORD said, I will give it you come thou with us, and we will do thee
good for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.

 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
own land, and to my kindred.

 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to
us instead of eyes.

 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'
journey and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in
the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.

 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
out of the camp.

 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that
hate thee flee before thee.

 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
thousands of Israel.

 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD and the
LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp.

 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched.

 And he called the name of the place Taberah because the fire of
the LORD burnt among them.

 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat?   We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt
freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
and the garlick  But now our soul is dried away there is nothing
at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.

 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium.

 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.

 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the LORD was
kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me?   Have I conceived
all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto
me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep
unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
heavy for me.

 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my
wretchedness.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,
and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

 And I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take
of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they
shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone.

 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow, and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us
in Egypt therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
ten days, nor twenty days;  But even a whole month, until it come
out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you because that ye
have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,
saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?   And Moses said, The
people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou
hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,
to suffice them?   And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's
hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to
pass unto thee or not.

 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
round about the tabernacle.

 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders
and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied, and did not cease.

 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad and the spirit rested
upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out
unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp.

 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp.

 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put
his spirit upon them!   And Moses gat him into the camp, he and
the elders of Israel.

 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's
journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other
side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the
face of the earth.

 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
all the next day, and they gathered the quails he that gathered least
gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves
round about the camp.

 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the
LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah because
there they buried the people that lusted.

 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
and abode at Hazeroth.

 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
woman whom he had married for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he
not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
upon the face of the earth.)   And the LORD spake suddenly unto
Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the
tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.

 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in
the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam and they both
came forth.

 And he said, Hear now my words If there be a prophet among you,
I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak
unto him in a dream.

 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
departed.

 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
Miriam became leprous, white as snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam,
and, behold, she was leprous.

 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we
have sinned.

 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
beseech thee.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from
the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.

 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people
journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
the wilderness of Paran.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Send thou men, that
they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one
a ruler among them.

 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
wilderness of Paran all those men were heads of the children of
Israel.

 And these were their names of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
son of Zaccur.

 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi
the son of Susi.

 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
land.

And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain
 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;  And what
the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what
cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong
holds;  And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether
there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of
the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe
grapes.

 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron
was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)   And they came unto
the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they
brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,
to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the
congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the
fruit of it.

 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
the cities are walled, and very great and moreover we saw the
children of Anak there.

 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the Hittites,
and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains and the
Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
against the people; for they are stronger than we.

 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which
we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great
stature.

 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were
in their sight.

 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
the people wept that night.

 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we
had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this
wilderness!   And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this
land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be
a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?   And they
said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into
Egypt.

 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
of the congregation of the children of Israel.

 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes  And they
spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The
land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.

 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of
the land; for they are bread for us their defence is departed from
them, and the LORD is with us fear them not.

 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation
before all the children of Israel.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke
me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs
which I have shewed among them?   I will smite them with the
pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater
nation and mightier than they.

 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,
(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they
have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art
seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that
thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a
pillar of fire by night.

 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 
Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which
he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.

 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,
according as thou hast spoken, saying,  The LORD is
longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and
transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation.

 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this
people, from Egypt even until now.

 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word 
But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory
of the LORD.

 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now
these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;  Surely they
shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall
any of them that provoked me see it  But my servant Caleb,
because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,
him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall
possess it.

 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the
Red sea.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  How
long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against
me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they
murmur against me.

 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you  Your carcases shall
fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according
to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have
murmured against me.

 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and
Joshua the son of Nun.

 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will
I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
wilderness.

 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
wilderness.

 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even
forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.

 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
congregation, that are gathered together against me in this
wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,
and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a
slander upon the land,  Even those men that did bring up the evil
report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.

 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.

 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel
and the people mourned greatly.

 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the
place which the LORD hath promised for we have sinned.

 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten
before your enemies.

 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and
ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the LORD,
therefore the LORD will not be with you.

 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the
ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the
camp.

 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land
of your habitations, which I give unto you,  And will make an
offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in
performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,
to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock
 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of
an hin of oil.

 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD 
Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
lamb, or a kid.

 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
every one according to their number.

 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
unto the LORD.

 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever
in your generations as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the
LORD.

 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
that sojourneth with you.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land
whither I bring you,  Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the
bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall
ye heave it.

 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
offering in your generations.

 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,  Even all that the LORD
hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD
commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;  Then
it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge
of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young
bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with
his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is
ignorance and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by
fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their
ignorance  And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the
children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;
seeing all the people were in ignorance.

 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
goat of the first year for a sin offering.

 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an
atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the
stranger that sojourneth among them.

 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born
in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that
soul shall be cut off from among his people.

 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity
shall be upon him.

 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
should be done to him.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the
camp.

 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the
borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they
put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue  And it
shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember
all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not
after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a
whoring  That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and
be holy unto your God.

 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Egypt, to be your God I am the LORD your God.

 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,
sons of Reuben, took men  And they rose up before Moses, with
certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of
the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown  And they
gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said
unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are
holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them wherefore then
lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?   And
when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face  And he spake unto
Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will
shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near
unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto
him.

 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;  And
put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow
and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be
holy ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi
 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near
to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to
stand before the congregation to minister unto them?   And he
hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi
with thee and seek ye the priesthood also?   For which cause
both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD
and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?   And Moses sent
to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab which said, We will not
come up  Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of
a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,
except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?   Moreover
thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,
or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the
eyes of these men? we will not come up.

 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
thou their offering I have not taken one ass from them, neither have
I hurt one of them.

 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow  And take every
man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD
every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and
Aaron, each of you his censer.

 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation with Moses and Aaron.

 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the LORD
appeared unto all the congregation.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume
them in a moment.

 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with
all the congregation?   And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
elders of Israel followed him.

 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest
ye be consumed in all their sins.

 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
on every side and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door
of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little
children.

 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me
to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.

 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent
me.

 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,
and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go
down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have
provoked the LORD.

 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them  And
the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,
and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.

 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
pit, and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the
congregation.

 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
them for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto Eleazar
the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the
burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.

 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered
them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a
sign unto the children of Israel.

 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a
covering of the altar  To be a memorial unto the children of
Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near
to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his
company as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the
people of the LORD.

 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
congregation and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the
LORD appeared.

 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Get you up from
among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And
they fell upon their faces.

 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the
congregation, and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone
out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people and
he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
stayed.

 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.

 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation and the plague was stayed.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to
the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the
house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every man's name upon
his rod.

 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi for one
rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall
choose, shall blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmurings
of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to
their fathers' houses, even twelve rods and the rod of Aaron was
among their rods.

 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of
witness.

 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of
Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and
yielded almonds.

 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all
the children of Israel and they looked, and took every man his rod.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt
quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

 And Moses did so as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we
die, we perish, we all perish.

 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD
shall die shall we be consumed with dying?   And the LORD said
unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall
bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee
shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and
minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister
before the tabernacle of witness.

 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary
and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of
Israel.

 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among
the children of Israel to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,
to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall
serve I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of
gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the
charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the
children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the
anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.

 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
fire every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and
every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs
which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for
thy sons.

 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
it it shall be holy unto thee.

 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
the wave offerings of the children of Israel I have given them unto
thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for
ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.

 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the
LORD, them have I given thee.

 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring
unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house
shall eat of it.

 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine
nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the
firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,
after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.

 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy thou shalt
sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an
offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as
the right shoulder are thine.

 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy
daughters with thee, by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt
for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.

 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in
their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them I am thy part
and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.

 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even
the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a
statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children
of Israel they have no inheritance.

 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an
heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit
therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they
shall have no inheritance.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Thus speak unto the
Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the
tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye
shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part
of the tithe.

 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of
the winepress.

 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all
your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall
give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.

 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of
it.

 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best
thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the
increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.

 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households for
it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of
the children of Israel, lest ye die.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,  This
is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer
without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke
 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring
her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face
 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the
congregation seven times  And one shall burn the heifer in his
sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he
burn  And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and
scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the
priest shall be unclean until the even.

 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be
kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of
separation it is a purification for sin.

 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
clothes, and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the
children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,
for a statute for ever.

 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
days.

 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third
day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that
soul shall be cut off from Israel because the water of separation was
not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet
upon him.

 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent all that come into
the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
unclean.

 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be
unclean seven days.

 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put
thereto in a vessel  And a clean person shall take hyssop, and
dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the
vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that
touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave  And the
clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on
the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at
even.

 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he
hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD the water of separation hath
not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.

 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that
toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and
the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
into the desert of Zin in the first month and the people abode in
Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

 And there was no water for the congregation and they gathered
themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!   And why
have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,
that we and our cattle should die there?   And wherefore have ye
made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?
it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;
neither is there any water to drink.

 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon
their faces and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take the rod, and
gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and
speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his
water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so
thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.

 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch
you water out of this rock?   And Moses lifted up his hand, and
with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out
abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me
not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore
ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given
them.

 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us  How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have
dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our
fathers  And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,
and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt and,
behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border 
Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country we will not pass
through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of
the water of the wells we will go by the king's high way, we will not
turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy
borders.

 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
out against thee with the sword.

 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high
way and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for
it I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.

 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border
wherefore Israel turned away from him.

 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
coast of the land of Edom, saying,  Aaron shall be gathered unto
his people for he shall not enter into the land which I have given
unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at
the water of Meribah.

 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
Hor  And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
his son and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die
there.

 And Moses did as the LORD commanded and they went up into mount
Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount and
Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard
tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against
Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy
their cities.

 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and
he called the name of the place Hormah.

 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much
discouraged because of the way.

 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there
is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this
light bread.

 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit
the people; and much people of Israel died.

 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for
we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,
that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
people.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
it upon a pole and it shall come to pass, that every one that is
bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the
serpent of brass, he lived.

 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
Amorites for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
Amorites.

 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,  And at the
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth
upon the border of Moab.

 And from thence they went to Beer that is the well whereof the
LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give
them water.

 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it
 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,
by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the
wilderness they went to Mattanah  And from Mattanah to Nahaliel
and from Nahaliel to Bamoth  And from Bamoth in the valley, that
is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward
Jeshimon.

 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
saying,  Let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the
fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the
well but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past
thy borders.

 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border
but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against
Israel into the wilderness and he came to Jahaz, and fought against
Israel.

 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon for
the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

 And Israel took all these cities and Israel dwelt in all the
cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out
of his hand, even unto Arnon.

 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
let the city of Sihon be built and prepared  For there is a fire
gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon it hath consumed
Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.

 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh he hath
given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto
Sihon king of the Amorites.

 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.

 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan and Og the
king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the
battle at Edrei.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not for I have delivered
him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at
Heshbon.

 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there
was none left him alive and they possessed his land.

 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains
of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
Amorites.

 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many
and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field.

And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his
people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from
Egypt behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over
against me  Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this
people; for they are too mighty for me peradventure I shall prevail,
that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land for
I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest
is cursed.

 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and
spake unto him the words of Balak.

 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me and the princes of
Moab abode with Balaam.

 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
hath sent unto me, saying,  Behold, there is a people come out of
Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth come now, curse me them;
peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
shalt not curse the people for they are blessed.

 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
Balak, Get you into your land for the LORD refuseth to give me leave
to go with you.

 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than
they.

 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto
me  For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will
do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore, I pray thee, curse
me this people.

 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.

 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I
may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I
shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
with the princes of Moab.

 And God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of
the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was
riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way,
and went into the field and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into
the way.

 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall and he
smote her again.

 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the
left.

 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under
Balaam and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a
staff.

 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these
three times?   And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast
mocked me I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I
kill thee.

 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont
to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand and he
bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand
thee, because thy way is perverse before me  And the ass saw me,
and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me,
surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore, if
it displease thee, I will get me back again.

 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men but
only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So
Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in
the utmost coast.

 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed
to promote thee to honour?   And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am
come unto thee have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word
that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
princes that were with him.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see
the utmost part of the people.

 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
on every altar a bullock and a ram.

 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
will go peradventure the LORD will come to meet me and whatsoever he
sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

 And God met Balaam and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.

 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto
Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,
curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
whom the LORD hath not defied?   For from the top of the rocks I
see him, and from the hills I behold him lo, the people shall dwell
alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.

 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last
end be like his!   And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou
done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou
hast blessed them altogether.

 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
which the LORD hath put in my mouth?   And Balak said unto him,
Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest
see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not
see them all and curse me them from thence.

 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on
every altar.

 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while
I meet the LORD yonder.

 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,
Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath
the LORD spoken?   And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,
Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor  God is not
a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should
repent hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and
shall he not make it good?   Behold, I have received commandment
to bless and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
perverseness in Israel the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of
a king is among them.

 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
of an unicorn.

 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said
of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!   Behold, the
people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young
lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the
blood of the slain.

 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
them at all.

 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?   And Balak
said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another
place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them
from thence.

 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
toward Jeshimon.

 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
ram on every altar.

 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he
went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his
face toward the wilderness.

 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.

 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said  He hath said,
which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty,
falling into a trance, but having his eyes open  How goodly are
thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!   As the
valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the
trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees
beside the waters.

 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be
in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his
kingdom shall be exalted.

 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and
shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.

 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion who shall
stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that
curseth thee.

 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
hands together and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse
mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these
three times.

 Therefore now flee thou to thy place I thought to promote thee
unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.

 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me, saying,  If Balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of
the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD
saith, that will I speak?   And now, behold, I go unto my people
come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to
thy people in the latter days.

 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said  He hath
said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most
High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but
having his eyes open  I shall see him, but not now I shall
behold him, but not nigh there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a
Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,
and destroy all the children of Sheth.

 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession
for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
destroy him that remaineth of the city.

 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that
he perish for ever.

 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.

 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
carry thee away captive.

 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when
God doeth this!   And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,
and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall
perish for ever.

 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place and
Balak also went his way.

 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and
the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor and the anger of the
LORD was kindled against Israel.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,
and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce
anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his
men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto
his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the
sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were
weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a
javelin in his hand;  And he went after the man of Israel into the
tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the
woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
Israel.

 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Phinehas, the son
of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away
from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among
them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace
 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant
of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and
made an atonement for the children of Israel.

 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince
of a chief house among the Simeonites.

 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,
the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house
in Midian.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Vex the Midianites,
and smite them  For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith
they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of
Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was
slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,  Take
the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty
years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are
able to go to war in Israel.

 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of
Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,  Take the sum of the people,
from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the
children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.

that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six
hundred.

 These are the sons of Dan after their families of Shuham, the
family of the Shuhamites. These are the families of Dan after their
families.

 All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those that were
numbered of them, were threescore and four thousand and four hundred.

 Of the children of Asher after their families of Jimna, the
family of the Jimnites of Jesui, the family of the Jesuites of
Beriah, the family of the Beriites.

 Of the sons of Beriah of Heber, the family of the Heberites of
Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites.

 And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarah.

 These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those
that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand and four
hundred.

 Of the sons of Naphtali after their families of Jahzeel, the
family of the Jahzeelites of Guni, the family of the Gunites 
Of Jezer, the family of the Jezerites of Shillem, the family of the

 These are the families of Naphtali according to their families
and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and
four hundred.

 These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred
thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Unto these the land
shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.

 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou
shalt give the less inheritance to every one shall his inheritance be
given according to those that were numbered of him.

 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot according to
the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
between many and few.

 And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their
families of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites of Kohath, the
family of the Kohathites of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

 These are the families of the Levites the family of the
Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites,
the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korathites. And Kohath
begat Amram.

 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi,
whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt and she bare unto Amram Aaron
and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before
the LORD.

 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
thousand, all males from a month old and upward for they were not
numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no
inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by
Jordan near Jericho.

 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron
the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the
wilderness of Sinai.

 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son
of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son
of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of
Manasseh the son of Joseph and these are the names of his daughters;
Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and
before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, saying,  Our father died in the
wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered
themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died
in his own sin, and had no sons.

 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession
among the brethren of our father.

 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  The daughters of
Zelophehad speak right thou shalt surely give them a possession of an
inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the
inheritance of their father to pass unto them.

 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a
man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass
unto his daughter.

 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance
unto his brethren.

 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
unto his father's brethren.

 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he
shall possess it and it shall be unto the children of Israel a
statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of
Israel.

 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy
people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in
the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before
their eyes that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness
of Zin.

 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,  Let the LORD, the
God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the
congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a
man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;  And set
him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and
give him a charge in their sight.

 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD at his
word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he,
and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him and he took Joshua, and
set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation
 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Command the children
of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my
sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe
to offer unto me in their due season.

 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire
which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year
without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb
shalt thou offer at even;  And a tenth part of an ephah of flour
for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten
oil.

 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin
for the one lamb in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine
to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even as the meat offering
of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer
it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot,
and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil,
and the drink offering thereof  This is the burnt offering of
every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink
offering.

 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs
of the first year without spot;  And three tenth deals of flour
for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth
deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;
 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a
sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of
an hin unto a lamb this is the burnt offering of every month
throughout the months of the year.

 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall
be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink
offering.

 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of
the LORD.

 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast seven days
shall unleavened bread be eaten.

 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no

 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
which is for a continual burnt offering.

 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and
his drink offering.

 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye
shall do no servile work.

 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat

of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two
tenth deals unto one ram,  A several tenth deal unto one lamb,
throughout the seven lambs;  And one kid of the goats, to make an
atonement for you.

 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his

drink offerings.

 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall
have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work it is a day of

 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,

 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the
LORD commanded Moses.

 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath
commanded.

 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according
to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
bond, being in her father's house in her youth;  And her father
hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her
father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and
every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul,
shall stand and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father
disallowed her.

 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;  And her
husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard
it then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her
soul shall stand.

 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered
with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect and the
LORD shall forgive her.

 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith
they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a
bond with an oath;  And her husband heard it, and held his peace
at her, and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand, and
every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her
vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand her husband
hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.

 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to
day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are
upon her he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the
day that he heard them.

 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between
a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in
her youth in her father's house.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Avenge the children
of Israel of the Midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy
people.

 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves
unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the
LORD of Midian.

 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
shall ye send to the war.

 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy
instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.

 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
Moses; and they slew all the males.

 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that
were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five
kings of Midian Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,
and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all
their flocks, and all their goods.

 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
their goodly castles, with fire.

 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
of beasts.

 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto
Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the
children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by
Jordan near Jericho.

 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from
the battle.

 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel
of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,
and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.

 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
with him, keep alive for yourselves.

 And do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath
killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both
yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.

 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and
all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded
Moses;  Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the
tin, and the lead,  Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall
make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean nevertheless it
shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth
not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall
be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Take the sum of the
prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the
priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation  And divide
the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who
went out to battle, and between all the congregation  And levy a
tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle one
soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of
the asses, and of the sheep  Take it of their half, and give it
unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.

 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of
the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,
which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.

 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
Moses.

 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five
thousand sheep,  And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 
And threescore and one thousand asses,  And thirty and two
thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with
him.

 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
thousand and five hundred sheep  And the LORD's tribute of the
sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.

 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's
tribute was threescore and twelve.

 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's
tribute was thirty and two persons.

 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering,
unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from
the men that warred,  (Now the half that pertained unto the
congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven
thousand and five hundred sheep,  And thirty and six thousand
beeves,  And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,  And
sixteen thousand persons;)  Even of the children of Israel's
half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and
gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of
the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses
 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the
men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man
of us.

 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,
earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the
LORD.

 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all
wrought jewels.

 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,
was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of
the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the
LORD.

 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of Jazer, and
the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the
congregation, saying,  Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,
and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,  Even
the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is
a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle  Wherefore, said
they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto
thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.

 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?  
And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?   Thus
did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.

 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they
should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.

 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
saying,  Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from
twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly
followed me  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and
Joshua the son of Nun for they have wholly followed the LORD.

 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,
that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.

 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase
of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward
Israel.

 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them
in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones  But we
ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we
have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in
the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel
have inherited every man his inheritance.

 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan
eastward.

 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
go armed before the LORD to war,  And will go all of you armed
over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from
before him,  And the land be subdued before the LORD then
afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and
before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.

 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
LORD and be sure your sin will find you out.

 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;
and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
shall be there in the cities of Gilead  But thy servants will
pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my
lord saith.

 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the
children of Israel  And Moses said unto them, If the children of
Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every
man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued
before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a
possession  But if they will not pass over with you armed, they
shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.

 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,
that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be
ours.

 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to
the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of
Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of
Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,
even the cities of the country round about.

 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,  And
Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities and folds for sheep.

 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
Kirjathaim,  And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,)
and Shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.

 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he
dwelt therein.

 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
thereof, and called them Havothjair.

 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
called it Nobah, after his own name.

 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of
Moses and Aaron.

 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by
the commandment of the LORD and these are their journeys according to
their goings out.

 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the
fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the
children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the
Egyptians.

 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had
smitten among them upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.

 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in
Succoth.

 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in
the edge of the wilderness.

 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
which is before Baalzephon and they pitched before Migdol.

 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the
midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in
the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim and in Elim were
twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they
pitched there.

 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the
wilderness of Sin.

 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
encamped in Dophkah.

 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was
no water for the people to drink.

 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness
of Sinai.

 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
Kibrothhattaavah.

 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at
Hazeroth.

 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness
of Zin, which is Kadesh.

 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the
edge of the land of Edom.

 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children
of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the
fifth month.

 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he
died in mount Hor.

 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the
land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
border of Moab.

 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.

 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the
mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in
the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto
Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
near Jericho, saying,  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say
unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their
molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places  And
ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein
for I have given you the land to possess it.

 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and
to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every man's
inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to
the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.

 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain
of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and
shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
thought to do unto them.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Command the children
of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan;
(this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even
the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof)  Then your south
quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of
Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea
eastward  And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent
of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin and the going forth thereof shall be
from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and
pass on to Azmon  And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon
unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea
for a border this shall be your west border.

 And this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall
point out for you mount Hor  From mount Hor ye shall point out
your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the
border shall be to Zedad  And the border shall go on to Ziphron,
and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan this shall be your
north border.

 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to
Shepham  And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on
the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach
unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward  And the border
shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt
sea this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.

 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the
land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give
unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe  For the tribe of
the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and
the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their
fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of
Manasseh have received their inheritance  The two tribes and the
half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near
Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  These are the names
of the men which shall divide the land unto you Eleazar the priest,
and Joshua the son of Nun.

 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land
by inheritance.

 And the names of the men are these Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb
the son of Jephunneh.

 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
Ammihud.

 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the
son of Jogli.

 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the
children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel
the son of Shiphtan.

 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel
the son of Azzan.

 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the
son of Shelomi.

 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel
the son of Ammihud.

 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance
unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
near Jericho, saying,  Command the children of Israel, that they
give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to
dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the
cities round about them.

 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of
them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their
beasts.

 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand
cubits round about.

 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two
thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the
west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand
cubits; and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the
suburbs of the cities.

 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there
shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the
manslayer, that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty
and two cities.

 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be
forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbs.

 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of
the children of Israel from them that have many ye shall give many;
but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of
his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he
inheriteth.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan
into the land of Canaan;  Then ye shall appoint you cities to be
cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which
killeth any person at unawares.

 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in
judgment.

 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have
for refuge.

 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities
shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.

 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them that
every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.

 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die,
he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death.

 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,
and he die, he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to
death.

 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may
die, and he die, he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to
death.

 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he
meeteth him, he shall slay him.

 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
wait, that he die;  Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he
die he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a
murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he
meeteth him.

 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon
him any thing without laying of wait,  Or with any stone,
wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he
die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm  Then the
congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood
according to these judgments  And the congregation shall deliver
the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the
congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he
was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest,
which was anointed with the holy oil.

 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;  And the revenger of
blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the
revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood
 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until
the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest
the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.

 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by
the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any
person to cause him to die.

 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
murderer, which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to
death.

 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land,
until the death of the priest.

 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it
defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that
is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.

 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I
dwell for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead,
the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of
Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the
chief fathers of the children of Israel  And they said, The LORD
commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the
children of Israel and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the
inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of
the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the
inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the
tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot
of our inheritance.

 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe
whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away
from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word
of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.

 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think
best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they
marry.

 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of Israel shall
keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe
of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the
tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man
the inheritance of his fathers.

 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall
keep himself to his own inheritance.

 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
Zelophehad  For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and
Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
brothers' sons  And they were married into the families of the
sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in
the tribe of the family of their father.

 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the
plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.




The Fifth Book of Moses  Called Deuteronomy


 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side
Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,
between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)   And it came to pass in the fortieth
year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses
spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD
had given him in commandment unto them;  After he had slain Sihon
the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of
Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei  On this side Jordan, in
the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,  The
LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough
in this mount  Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the
mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea
side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great
river, the river Euphrates.

 Behold, I have set the land before you go in and possess the land
which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to
give unto them and to their seed after them.

 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear
you myself alone  The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,
behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many
more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)   How can
I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is
good for us to do.

 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over
hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
officers among your tribes.

 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes
between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his
brother, and the stranger that is with him.

 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;
for the judgment is God's and the cause that is too hard for you,
bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should
do.

 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great
and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of
the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to
Kadeshbarnea.

 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee go up and
possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear
not, neither be discouraged.

 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send
men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us
word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall
come.

 And the saying pleased me well and I took twelve men of you, one
of a tribe  And they turned and went up into the mountain, and
came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a
good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
commandment of the LORD your God  And ye murmured in your tents,
and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of
the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to
destroy us.

 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great
and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakims there.

 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 
And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God
bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
until ye came into this place.

 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,  Who
went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your
tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and
in a cloud by day.

 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
sware, saying,  Surely there shall not one of these men of this
evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
fathers.

 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will
I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,
because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also
shalt not go in thither.

 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall
go in thither encourage him for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they
shall possess it.

 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God
commanded us.

And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready
to go up into the hill.

 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.

 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
Hormah.

 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not
hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
abode there.

 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me and we compassed mount
Seir many days.

 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,  Ye have compassed this
mountain long enough turn you northward.

 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the
coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and
they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves
therefore  Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their
land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
Seir unto Esau for a possession.

 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall
also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these
forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked
nothing.

 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
contend with them in battle for I will not give thee of their land
for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for
a possession.

 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,
and tall, as the Anakims;  Which also were accounted giants, as
the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.

 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,
and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his
possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
went over the brook Zered.

 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were
come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as
the LORD sware unto them.

 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them
from among the host, until they were consumed.

 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
dead from among the people,  That the LORD spake unto me, saying,
 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day
 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
distress them not, nor meddle with them for I will not give thee of
the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given
it unto the children of Lot for a possession.

 (That also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein
in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;  A people
great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them
before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead 
As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and
dwelt in their stead even unto this day  And the Avims which
dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth
out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)   Rise
ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon behold, I
have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his
land begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.

 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear
report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.

 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,  Let me pass
through thy land I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn
unto the right hand nor to the left.

 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
water for money, that I may drink only I will pass through on my
feet;  (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the
Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him for the
LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that
he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and
his land before thee begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his
land.

 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight
at Jahaz.

 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,
and his sons, and all his people.

 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left
none to remain  Only the cattle we took for a prey unto
ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.

 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from
the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one
city too strong for us the LORD our God delivered all unto us 
Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto
any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains,
nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan and Og the king of
Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not for I will deliver him,
and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do
unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at
Heshbon.

 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of
Bashan, and all his people and we smote him until none was left to
him remaining.

 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of
Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
beside unwalled towns a great many.

 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every
city.

 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
prey to ourselves.

 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of
Arnon unto mount Hermon;  (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;
and the Amorites call it Shenir;)  All the cities of the plain,
and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the
kingdom of Og in Bashan.

 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of
the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four
cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which
is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,
gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,
gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with
all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead
even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto
the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth
even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah
eastward.

 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath
given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before
your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.

 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I
have given you;  Until the LORD have given rest unto your
brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land
which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan and then shall
ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen
all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings so shall
the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

 Ye shall not fear them for the LORD your God he shall fight for
you.

 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,  O Lord GOD,
thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty
hand for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do
according to thy works, and according to thy might?   I pray thee,
let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that
goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear
me and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto
me of this matter.

 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it
with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him for he
shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit
the land which thou shalt see.

 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go
in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.

 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall
ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the
LORD your God which I command you.

 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor for all
the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them
from among you.

 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one
of you this day.

 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD
my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
possess it.

 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and
understanding people.

 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,
as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?  
And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so
righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?   Only
take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget
the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy
heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons, and thy sons'
sons;  Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy
God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to
fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that
they may teach their children.

 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and
thick darkness.

 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye
heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a
voice.

 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of
stone.

 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
possess it.

 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of
the midst of the fire  Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a
graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or
female,  The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the
likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,  The likeness
of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish
that is in the waters beneath the earth  And lest thou lift up
thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and
the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship
them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all
nations under the whole heaven.

 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
inheritance, as ye are this day.

 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware
that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto
that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance
 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan but ye
shall go over, and possess that good land.

 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or
the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.

 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye
shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,
and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do
evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger  I
call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall
soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to
possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly
be destroyed.

 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be
left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.

 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and
stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt
find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon
thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and
shalt be obedient unto his voice;  (For the LORD thy God is a
merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor
forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.

 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the
one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such
thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?   Did
ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the
fire, as thou hast heard, and live?   Or hath God assayed to go
and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by
temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty
hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to
all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he
is God; there is none else beside him.

 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou
heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed
after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power
out of Egypt;  To drive out nations from before thee greater and
mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for
an inheritance, as it is this day.

 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the
LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath there is
none else.

 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with
thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon
the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
sunrising;  That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill
his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
fleeing unto one of these cities he might live  Namely, Bezer in
the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in
Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.

 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
Israel  These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they
came forth out of Egypt.

 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the
land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses
and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of
Egypt  And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan
toward the sunrising;  From Aroer, which is by the bank of the
river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,  And all the
plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain,
under the springs of Pisgah.

 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,
the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that
ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
midst of the fire,  (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,
to shew you the word of the LORD for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,  I am the LORD thy
God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
bondage.

 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
that is in the waters beneath the earth  Thou shalt not bow down
thyself unto them, nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me,  And shewing
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.

 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee.

 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work  But the
seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant,
nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy
cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant
and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.

 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and
that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand
and by a stretched out arm therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee
to keep the sabbath day.

 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go
well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 Thou shalt not kill.

 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

 Neither shalt thou steal.

 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his
maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.

 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness,
with a great voice and he added no more. And he wrote them in two
tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near
unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;  And
ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his
greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire
we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.

 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume
us if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall
die.

 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the
living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and
lived?   Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall
say and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto
thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of
this people, which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all
that they have spoken.

 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,
and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,
and with their children for ever!   Go say to them, Get you into
your tents again.

 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which
thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give
them to possess it.

 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the
left.

 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and
that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,
which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them
in the land whither ye go to possess it  That thou mightest fear
the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which
I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of
thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.

 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of
thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and
honey.

 Hear, O Israel The LORD our God is one LORD  And thou shalt
love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might.

 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
heart  And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy
gates.

 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou
buildedst not,  And houses full of all good things, which thou
filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and
olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and
be full;  Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought
thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear
by his name.

 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which
are round about you;  (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among
you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and
destroy thee from off the face of the earth.

 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
Massah.

 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,
and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.

 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
the LORD that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in
and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.

 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath
spoken.

 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean
the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD
our God hath commanded you?   Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We
were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt
with a mighty hand  And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great
and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before
our eyes  And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring
us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the
LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as
it is at this day.

 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.

 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou
goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the
Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations
greater and mightier than thou;  And when the LORD thy God shall
deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy
them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them
 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy
son.

 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may
serve other gods so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against
you, and destroy thee suddenly.

 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,
and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their
graven images with fire.

 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God the LORD thy
God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all
people that are upon the face of the earth.

 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all
people  But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep
the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought
you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of
bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand generations;  And repayeth them that
hate him to their face, to destroy them he will not be slack to him
that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.

 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and
the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep
unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers
 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee he will
also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,
and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give
thee.

 Thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male
or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put
none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but
will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither
shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.

 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;
how can I dispossess them?   Thou shalt not be afraid of them but
shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto
all Egypt;  The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the
signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out
arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out so shall the LORD thy
God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until
they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the LORD thy God is
among you, a mighty God and terrible.

 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
little and little thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the
beasts of the field increase upon thee.

 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt
destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to
stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou
shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto
thee, lest thou be snared therin for it is an abomination to the LORD
thy God.

 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it, and
thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess
the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove
thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
commandments, or no.

 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that
he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.

 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,
these forty years.

 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to
walk in his ways, and to fear him.

 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys
and hills;  A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,
and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;  A land wherein
thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing
in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou
mayest dig brass.

 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD
thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his
commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command
thee this day  Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast
built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;  And when thy herds and
thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and
all that thou hast is multiplied;  Then thine heart be lifted up,
and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the
land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;  Who led thee through
that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and
scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee
forth water out of the rock of flint;  Who fed thee in the
wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might
humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy
latter end;  And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might
of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.

 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God for it is he that
giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant
which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and
walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify
against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of
the LORD your God.

 Hear, O Israel Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to
possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and
fenced up to heaven,  A people great and tall, the children of the
Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can
stand before the children of Anak!   Understand therefore this day,
that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a
consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down
before thy face so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them
quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.

 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath
cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD
hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of
these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.

 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,
dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these
nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and
that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this
good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a
stiffnecked people.

 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to
wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of
the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been
rebellious against the LORD.

 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was
angry with you to have destroyed you.

 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,
even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I
abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat
bread nor drink water  And the LORD delivered unto me two tables
of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written
according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount
out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the
covenant.

 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have
corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way
which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people  Let me alone,
that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven
and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.

 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
God, and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out
of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and
brake them before your eyes.

 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and
forty nights I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all
your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,
to provoke him to anger.

 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the
LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto
me at that time also.

 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him and
I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was
as small as dust and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that
descended out of the mount.

 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
provoked the LORD to wrath.

 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up
and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor
hearkened to his voice.

 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew
you.

 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as
I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy
you.

 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy
not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through
thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a
mighty hand.

 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto
the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their
sin  Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,
and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in
the wilderness.

 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.

 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone
like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee
an ark of wood.

 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first
tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone
like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables
in mine hand.

 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the
ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of
the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the LORD gave
them unto me.

 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD
commanded me.

 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
children of Jaakan to Mosera there Aaron died, and there he was
buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his
stead.

 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister
unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised
him.

 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time
also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto
their fathers to give unto them.

 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but
to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,
and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
soul,  To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,
which I command thee this day for thy good?   Behold, the heaven
and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with
all that therein is.

 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this
day.

 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
stiffnecked.

 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh
reward  He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and
widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

 Love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the
land of Egypt.

 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of
heaven for multitude.

 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,
and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

 And know ye this day for I speak not with your children which
have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD
your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,
 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;  And
what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their
chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as
they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this
day;  And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came
into this place;  And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons
of Eliab, the son of Reuben how the earth opened her mouth, and
swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel
 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he
did.

 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you
this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,
whither ye go to possess it;  And that ye may prolong your days in
the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and
to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs  But the
land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and
drinketh water of the rain of heaven  A land which the LORD thy
God careth for the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from
the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your
God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy
corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
mayest eat and be full.

 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye
turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;  And then the
LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that
there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye
perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be
as frontlets between your eyes.

 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when
thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
and upon thy gates  That your days may be multiplied, and the
days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your
fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his
ways, and to cleave unto him;  Then will the LORD drive out all
these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations
and mightier than yourselves.

 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be
yours from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river
Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

 There shall no man be able to stand before you for the LORD
your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the
land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 
A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I
command you this day  And a curse, if ye will not obey the
commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which
I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not
known.

 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou
shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount
Ebal.

 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun
goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the
champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?   For
ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD
your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which
I set before you this day.

 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to
do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to
possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and
upon the hills, and under every green tree  And ye shall
overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves
with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and
destroy the names of them out of that place.

 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall
ye seek, and thither thou shalt come  And thither ye shall bring
your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave
offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,
and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks  And there ye
shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that
ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy
God hath blessed thee.

 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
which the LORD your God giveth you.

 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD
your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all
your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;  Then there
shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his
name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;
your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave
offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the
LORD  And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and
your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as
he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
every place that thou seest  But in the place which the LORD
shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt
offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.

 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the
LORD thy God which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may
eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth
as water.

 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill
offerings, or heave offering of thine hand  But thou must eat
them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall
choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and
thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates and thou
shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine
hands unto.

 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
thou livest upon the earth.

 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul
longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul
lusteth after.

 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name
there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of
thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee,
and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the
life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
water.

 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the
sight of the LORD.

 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose  And
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon
the altar of the LORD thy God and the blood of thy sacrifices shall
be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat
the flesh.

 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when
thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy
God.

 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them,
and dwellest in their land;  Take heed to thyself that thou be
not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before
thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did
these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God for every
abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their
gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the
fire to their gods.

 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it thou shalt
not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
giveth thee a sign or a wonder,  And the sign or the wonder come
to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other
gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;  Thou
shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the
LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his
commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave
unto him.

 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God,
which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of
the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy
God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from
the midst of thee.

 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine
own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other
gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;  Namely,
of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee,
or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the
other end of the earth;  Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor
hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou
spare, neither shalt thou conceal him  But thou shalt surely kill
him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and
afterwards the hand of all the people.

 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought
thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
such wickedness as this is among you.

 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy
God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,  Certain men, the
children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn
the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,
which ye have not known;  Then shalt thou enquire, and make
search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing
certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;  Thou shalt
surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,
destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle
thereof, with the edge of the sword.

 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil
thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God and it shall be an heap for
ever; it shall not be built again.

 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand
that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee
mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath
sworn unto thy fathers;  When thou shalt hearken to the voice of
the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee
this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

 Ye are the children of the LORD your God ye shall not cut
yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD
hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the
nations that are upon the earth.

 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

 These are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox, the sheep, and
the goat,  The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the
wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall
eat.

 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or
of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and
the coney for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore
they are unclean unto you.

 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the
cud, it is unclean unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor
touch their dead carcase.

 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters all that have
fins and scales shall ye eat  And whatsoever hath not fins and
scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.

 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

 But these are they of which ye shall not eat the eagle, and the
ossifrage, and the ospray,  And the glede, and the kite, and the
vulture after his kind,  And every raven after his kind, 
And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after
his kind,  The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 
And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,  And the
stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you they
shall not be eaten.

 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself thou shalt
give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or
thou mayest sell it unto an alien for thou art an holy people unto
the LORD thy God.

Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the
field bringeth forth year by year.

 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy
wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy
flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.

 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able
to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy
God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath
blessed thee  Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up
the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD
thy God shall choose  And thou shalt bestow that money for
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for
wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and
thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice,
thou, and thine household,  And the Levite that is within thy
gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance
with thee.

 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates
 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are
within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the
LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou
doest.

 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

 And this is the manner of the release Every creditor that
lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact
it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the
LORD's release.

 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is
thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;  Save when there
shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to
possess it  Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the
LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command
thee this day.

 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee and thou
shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou
shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou
shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor
brother  But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt
surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying,
The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be
evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry
unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved
when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the LORD thy
God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest
thine hand unto.

 For the poor shall never cease out of the land therefore I
command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou
shalt let him go free from thee.

 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let
him go away empty  Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy
flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress of that
wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee therefore I command thee
this thing to day.

 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from
thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with
thee;  Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear
unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy
maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee,
in serving thee six years and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in
all that thou doest.

 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock
thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God thou shalt do no work with
the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.

 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the
place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind,
or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy
God.

 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates the unclean and the clean
person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it
upon the ground as water.

 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD
thy God for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth
out of Egypt by night.

 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy
God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall
choose to place his name there.

 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou
eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou
camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste that thou mayest
remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all
the days of thy life.

 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which
thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the
morning.

 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates,
which the LORD thy God giveth thee  But at the place which the
LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt
sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the
season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.

 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy
God shall choose and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy
tents.

 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day
shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God thou shalt do no work
therein.

 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee begin to number the
seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the
corn.

 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God
with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt
give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed
thee  And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and
thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant,
and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the
fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the
LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt and
thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine  And thou shalt
rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the
fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.

 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God
in the place which the LORD shall choose because the LORD thy God
shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine
hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD
thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened
bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles and
they shall not appear before the LORD empty  Every man shall
give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God
which he hath given thee.

 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which
the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes and they shall
judge the people with just judgment.

 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
neither take a gift for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and
pervert the words of the righteous.

 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou
mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God
hateth.

 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or
sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness for that is an
abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the
LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness
in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 
And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the
sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not
commanded;  And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and
enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
that such abomination is wrought in Israel  Then shalt thou bring
forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing,
unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with
stones, till they die.

 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that
is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he
shall not be put to death.

 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to
death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put
the evil away from among you.

 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke,
being matters of controversy within thy gates then shalt thou arise,
and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;
 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the
judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew
thee the sentence of judgment  And thou shalt do according to
the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose
shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that
they inform thee  According to the sentence of the law which
they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall
tell thee, thou shalt do thou shalt not decline from the sentence
which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.

 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken
unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy
God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die and thou shalt put
away the evil from Israel.

 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
presumptuously.

 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I
will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;
 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy
God shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over
thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy
brother.

 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the
people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses
forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return
no more that way.

 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn
not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and
gold.

 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,
that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which
is before the priests the Levites  And it shall be with him, and
he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to
fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these
statutes, to do them  That his heart be not lifted up above his
brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the
right hand, or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in
his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no
part nor inheritance with Israel they shall eat the offerings of the
LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren
the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them
that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give
unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,
and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to
stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.

 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the
place which the LORD shall choose;  Then he shall minister in the
name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which
stand there before the LORD.

 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of
the sale of his patrimony.

 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those
nations.

 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or
an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.

 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard,
or a necromancer.

 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD
and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out
from before thee.

 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
observers of times, and unto diviners but as for thee, the LORD thy
God hath not suffered thee so to do.

 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall
hearken;  According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy
God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again
the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any
more, that I die not.

 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they
have spoken.

 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto
them all that I shall command him.

 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto
my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name,
which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the
name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which
the LORD hath not spoken?   When a prophet speaketh in the name
of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the
thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him.

 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the
LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in
their cities, and in their houses;  Thou shalt separate three
cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God
giveth thee to possess it.

 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,
which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that
every slayer may flee thither.

 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
that he may live Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he
hated not in time past;  As when a man goeth into the wood with
his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe
to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and
lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of
those cities, and live  Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the
slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is
long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he
hated him not in time past.

 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
cities for thee.

 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto
thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto
thy fathers;  If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do
them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to
walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee,
beside these three  That innocent blood be not shed in thy land,
which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be
upon thee.

 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and
rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth
into one of these cities  Then the elders of his city shall send
and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of
blood, that he may die.

 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt
of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.

 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of
old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in
the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or
for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two
witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be
established.

 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
him that which is wrong;  Then both the men, between whom the
controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and
the judges, which shall be in those days;  And the judges shall
make diligent inquisition and, behold, if the witness be a false
witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;  Then
shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother
so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye
for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of
them for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of
the land of Egypt.

 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the
priest shall approach and speak unto the people,  And shall say
unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against
your enemies let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble,
neither be ye terrified because of them;  For the LORD your God is
he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save
you.

 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is
there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him
go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man
dedicate it.

 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet
eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in
the battle, and another man eat of it.

 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the
battle, and another man take her.

 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they
shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him
go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well
as his heart.

 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking
unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead
the people.

 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
proclaim peace unto it.

 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto
thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein
shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
against thee, then thou shalt besiege it  And when the LORD thy
God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male
thereof with the edge of the sword  But the women, and the
little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the
spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the
spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that
breatheth  But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the
Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the
Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee
 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the
LORD your God.

 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by
forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them, and thou
shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to
employ them in the siege  Only the trees which thou knowest that
they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and
thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,
until it be subdued.

 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath
slain him  Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and
they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is
slain  And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the
slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which
hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough
valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the
heifer's neck there in the valley  And the priests the sons of
Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to
minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their
word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried  And all
the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash
their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley  And
they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither
have our eyes seen it.

 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's
charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.

 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD
thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them
captive,  And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and
hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 
Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her
head, and pare her nails;  And she shall put the raiment of her
captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail
her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go
in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt
let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for
money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast
humbled her.

 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if
the firstborn son be hers that was hated  Then it shall be, when
he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make
the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is
indeed the firstborn  But he shall acknowledge the son of the
hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he
hath for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the
firstborn is his.

 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey
the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when
they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them  Then shall
his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the
elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;  And they
shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and
rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a
drunkard.

 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he
die so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall
hear, and fear.

 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to
be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree  His body shall not
remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him
that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be
not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and
hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto
thy brother.

 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be
with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it
to him again.

 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do
with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he
hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise thou mayest
not hide thyself.

 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the
way, and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift
them up again.

 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are
abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree,
or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam
sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam
with the young  But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and
take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou
mayest prolong thy days.

 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement
for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man
fall from thence.

 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds lest the fruit
of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be
defiled.

 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and
linen together.

 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 
And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name
upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found
her not a maid  Then shall the father of the damsel, and her
mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto
the elders of the city in the gate  And the damsel's father
shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife,
and he hateth her;  And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech
against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these
are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
cloth before the elders of the city.

 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
him;  And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver,
and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought
up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife; he
may not put her away all his days.

 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
found for the damsel  Then they shall bring out the damsel to
the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone
her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in
Israel, to play the whore in her father's house so shalt thou put
evil away from among you.

 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then
they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and
the woman so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.

 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a
man find her in the city, and lie with her;  Then ye shall bring
them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with
stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the
city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife so
thou shalt put away evil from among you.

 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
force her, and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall
die.

 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his
neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter  For he found
her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none
to save her.

 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed,
and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;  Then
the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty
shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled
her, he may not put her away all his days.

 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
father's skirt.

 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut
off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even
to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of
the LORD.

 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of
the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
congregation of the LORD for ever  Because they met you not with
bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and
because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of
Mesopotamia, to curse thee.

 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but
the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because
the LORD thy God loved thee.

 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days
for ever.

 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother thou
shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.

 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee
from every wicked thing.

 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of
the camp, he shall not come within the camp  But it shall be,
when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water and when the
sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
shalt go forth abroad  And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy
weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou
shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh
from thee  For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy
camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;
therefore shall thy camp be holy that he see no unclean thing in
thee, and turn away from thee.

 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
escaped from his master unto thee  He shall dwell with thee,
even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy
gates, where it liketh him best thou shalt not oppress him.

 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a
sodomite of the sons of Israel.

 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,
into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow for even both these
are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,
usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury 
Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou
shalt not lend upon usury that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all
that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to
possess it.

 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not
slack to pay it for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee;
and it would be sin in thee.

 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform;
even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD
thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.

 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest
eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any
in thy vessel.

 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then
thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a
sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some
uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and
give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
another man's wife.

 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his
house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;
 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again
to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination
before the LORD and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the
LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
neither shall he be charged with any business but he shall be free at
home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge
for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of
Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief
shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.

 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently,
and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you
as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.

 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after
that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
into his house to fetch his pledge.

 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge
 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun
goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee and
it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.

 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,
whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy
land within thy gates  At his day thou shalt give him his hire,
neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his
heart upon it lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin
unto thee.

 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither
shall the children be put to death for the fathers every man shall be
put to death for his own sin.

 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the
fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge  But thou shalt
remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God
redeemed thee thence therefore I command thee to do this thing.

 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it it
shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow that
the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
boughs again it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and
for the widow.

 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
glean it afterward it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless,
and for the widow.

 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
Egypt therefore I command thee to do this thing.

 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the
righteous, and condemn the wicked.

 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that
the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his
face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed lest, if he should
exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother
should seem vile unto thee.

 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger
her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to
wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.

 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not
put out of Israel.

 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his
brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My
husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in
Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.

 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him
and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;  Then
shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders,
and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall
answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build
up his brother's house.

 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that
hath his shoe loosed.

 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the
one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him
that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the
secrets  Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not
pity her.

 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
small.

 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and
a small.

 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the
land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are
an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come
forth out of Egypt;  How he met thee by the way, and smote the
hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou
wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.

 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee
rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD
thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt
blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not
forget it.

 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the
LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and
dwellest therein;  That thou shalt take of the first of all the
fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD
thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto
the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.

 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am
come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to
give us.

 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set
it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian
ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and
sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty,
and populous  And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted
us, and laid upon us hard bondage  And when we cried unto the
LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our
affliction, and our labour, and our oppression  And the LORD
brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an
outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and
with wonders  And he hath brought us into this place, and hath
given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the
LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God  And thou
shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given
unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the
stranger that is among you.

 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given
it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that
they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;  Then thou shalt
say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things
out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto
the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all
thy commandments which thou hast commanded me I have not transgressed
thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for
the dead but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and
have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.

 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest
unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul.

 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk
in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his
judgments, and to hearken unto his voice  And the LORD hath
avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised
thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;  And to
make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in
name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the
LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,
Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.

 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee
up great stones, and plaister them with plaister  And thou shalt
write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over,
that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy
fathers hath promised thee.

 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall
set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and
thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an
altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.

 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones
and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God
 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
rejoice before the LORD thy God.

 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
very plainly.

 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the
people of the LORD thy God.

 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do
his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.

 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,  These
shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come
over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph,
and Benjamin  And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse;
Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel
with a loud voice,  Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or
molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of
the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people
shall answer and say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And
all the people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the
people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And
all the people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say,
Amen.

 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And
all the people shall say, Amen.

 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do
them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto
the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his
commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will
set thee on high above all nations of the earth  And all these
blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken
unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in
the field.

 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the
flocks of thy sheep.

 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou
be when thou goest out.

 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to
be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way,
and flee before thee seven ways.

 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses,
and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee
in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he
hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD
thy God, and walk in his ways.

 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of
thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy
ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give
thee.

 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work
of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt
not borrow.

 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou
hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command
thee this day, to observe and to do them  And thou shalt not go
aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the
right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and
his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses
shall come upon thee, and overtake thee  Cursed shalt thou be in
the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.

 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou
be when thou goest out.

 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in
all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be
destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of
thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess
it.

 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever,
and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the
sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee
until thou perish.

 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
earth that is under thee shall be iron.

 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from
heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies
thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before
them and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not
be healed.

 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
astonishment of heart  And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the
blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and
thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
save thee.

 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her
thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein thou
shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
eat thereof thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy
face, and shall not be restored to thee thy sheep shall be given unto
thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.

 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day
long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which
thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed
alway  So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes
which thou shalt see.

 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a
sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the
top of thy head.

 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have
known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather
but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat
them.

 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou
shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his
fruit.

 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
them; for they shall go into captivity.

 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
high; and thou shalt come down very low.

 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him he shall
be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue
thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou
hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his
commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee  And they
shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for
ever.

 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and
with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; 
Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send
against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want
of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he
have destroyed thee.

 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue
thou shalt not understand;  A nation of fierce countenance, which
shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young
 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
land, until thou be destroyed which also shall not leave thee either
corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy
sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy
land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy
land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy
sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in
the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall
distress thee  So that the man that is tender among you, and
very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward
the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he
shall leave  So that he will not give to any of them of the
flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left
him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall
distress thee in all thy gates.

 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness
and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom,
and toward her son, and toward her daughter,  And toward her
young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her
children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all
things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy
shall distress thee in thy gates.

 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and
fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;  Then the LORD will make thy
plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,
and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou
be destroyed.

 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars
of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of
the LORD thy God.

 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to
do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to
destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from
off the land whither thou goest to possess it.

 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other
gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and
stone.

 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
the sole of thy foot have rest but the LORD shall give thee there a
trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind  And
thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and
night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life  In the morning
thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say,
Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou
shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again
and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and
bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside
the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto
Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;  The
great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those
great miracles  Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to
perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes
are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy
foot.

 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
drink that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and
Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote
them  And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.

 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye
may prosper in all that ye do.

 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the
men of Israel,  Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger
that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy
water  That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy
God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this
day  That he may establish thee to day for a people unto
himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto
thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
to Jacob.

 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD
our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day 
(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came
through the nations which ye passed by;  And ye have seen their
abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which
were among them)  Lest there should be among you man, or woman,
or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD
our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should
be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;  And it come
to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless
himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst  The
LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his
jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are
written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out
his name from under heaven.

 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes
of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are
written in this book of the law  So that the generation to come
of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that
shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of
that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 
And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,
that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like
the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the
LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath  Even all nations
shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what
meaneth the heat of this great anger?   Then men shall say,
Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their
fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the
land of Egypt  For they went and served other gods, and
worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given
unto them  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this
land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as
it is this day.

 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God but those things
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that
we may do all the words of this law.

 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD
thy God hath driven thee,  And shalt return unto the LORD thy God,
and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this
day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul;  That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and
have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,
from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he
fetch thee  And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land
which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart
of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with
all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all
his commandments which I command thee this day.

 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle,
and in the fruit of thy land, for good for the LORD will again
rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers  If
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his
commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul.

 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do
it?   Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear
it, and do it?   But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy
mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
and evil;  In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy
God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply and
the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to
possess it.

 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;  I
denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye
shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over
Jordan to go to possess it.

 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing therefore
choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live  That thou
mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and
that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life, and the length
of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware
unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this
day; I can no more go out and come in also the LORD hath said unto
me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them
and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.

 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do
unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded
you.

 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them
for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee.

 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of
all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with
this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers
to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee fear not, neither
be dismayed.

 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the
sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto
all the elders of Israel.

 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of
tabernacles,  When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD
thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
before all Israel in their hearing.

 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy
stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they
may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words
of this law  And that their children, which have not known any
thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye
live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
thou must die call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle
of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and
Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation.

 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud
and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and
will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall
be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that
they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because
our God is not among us?   And I will surely hide my face in that
day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are
turned unto other gods.

 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
children of Israel put it in their mouths, that this song may be a
witness for me against the children of Israel.

 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall
have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn
unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my
covenant.

 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for I
know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have
brought them into the land which I sware.

 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
children of Israel.

 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong
and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of Israel
into the land which I sware unto them and I will be with thee.

 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
words of this law in a book, until they were finished,  That
Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
LORD, saying,  Take this book of the law, and put it in the side
of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there
for a witness against thee.

 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck behold, while I am
yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD;
and how much more after my death?   Gather unto me all the elders
of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in
their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.

 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;
and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil
in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of
your hands.

 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
the words of this song, until they were ended.

 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
words of my mouth.

 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon
the grass  Because I will publish the name of the LORD ascribe
ye greatness unto our God.

 He is the Rock, his work is perfect for all his ways are
judgment a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.

 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his
children they are a perverse and crooked generation.

 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not
he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
established thee?   Remember the days of old, consider the years
of many generations ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
elders, and they will tell thee.

 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when
he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of Israel.

 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance.

 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the
apple of his eye.

 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings
 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
with him.

 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might
eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of
the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;  Butter of kine, and
milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and
goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure
blood of the grape.

 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked thou art waxen fat, thou art
grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which
made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
abominations provoked they him to anger.

 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew
not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
forgotten God that formed thee.

 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
their end shall be for they are a very froward generation, children
in whom is no faith.

 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they
have provoked me to anger with their vanities and I will move them to
jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to
anger with a foolish nation.

 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on
fire the foundations of the mountains.

 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
them.

 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
and with bitter destruction I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray
hairs.

 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
remembrance of them to cease from among men  Were it not that I
feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave
themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and
the LORD hath not done all this.

 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
understanding in them.

 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
would consider their latter end!   How should one chase a
thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had
sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?   For their rock is not
as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.

 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
Gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter
 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
asps.

 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
treasures?   To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot
shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand, and
the things that shall come upon them make haste.

 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none
shut up, or left.

 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
trusted,  Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank
the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
be your protection.

 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me I
kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal neither is there any that
can deliver out of my hand.

 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward
them that hate me.

 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people for he will avenge the
blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,
and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears
of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel
 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which
I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to
observe to do, all the words of this law.

 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life and
through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye
go over Jordan to possess it.

 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in
the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of
Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession
 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto
thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered
unto his people  Because ye trespassed against me among the
children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness
of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
Israel.

 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed
the children of Israel before his death.

 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands
of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them.

 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand and
they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.

 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
congregation of Jacob.

 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the
tribes of Israel were gathered together.

 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

 And this is the blessing of Judah and he said, Hear, LORD, the
voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people let his hands be
sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.

 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst
strive at the waters of Meribah;  Who said unto his father and to
his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his
brethren, nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word,
and kept thy covenant.

 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law they
shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine
altar.

 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them
that hate him, that they rise not again.

 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in
safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he
shall dwell between his shoulders.

 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the
precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth
beneath,  And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,
and for the precious things put forth by the moon,  And for the
chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of
the lasting hills,  And for the precious things of the earth and
fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush
let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
head of him that was separated from his brethren.

 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people
together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of
Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
Issachar, in thy tents.

 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the
abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad he
dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.

 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a
portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of
the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments
with Israel.

 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp he shall leap from
Bashan.

 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and
full with the blessing of the LORD possess thou the west and the
south.

 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
strength be.

 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;
and shall say, Destroy them.

 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of Jacob
shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop
down dew.

 Happy art thou, O Israel who is like unto thee, O people saved
by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy
excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou
shalt tread upon their high places.

 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD
shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,  And all Naphtali,
and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto
the utmost sea,  And the south, and the plain of the valley of
Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy
seed I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not
go over thither.

 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
according to the word of the LORD.

 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
Bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.

 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his
eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
Moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of Israel
hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
whom the LORD knew face to face,  In all the signs and the
wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to
Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,  And in
all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed
in the sight of all Israel.




The Book of Joshua


 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to
pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,
saying,  Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over
this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give
to them, even to the children of Israel.

 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have
I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,
the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great
sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.

 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days
of thy life as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee I will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee.

 Be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou
divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers
to give them.

 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee
turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest
prosper withersoever thou goest.

 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do
according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy
way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
afraid, neither be thou dismayed for the LORD thy God is with thee
whithersoever thou goest.

 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you
victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go
in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess
it.

 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe
of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,  Remember the word which Moses
the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath
given you rest, and hath given you this land.

 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass
before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help
them;  Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath
given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
God giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your
possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on
this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we
will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
hearken unto thee only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with
Moses.

 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will
not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall
be put to death only be strong and of a good courage.

 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and
came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.

 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came
men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the
country.

 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the
men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house for
they be come to search out all the country.

 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were  And it came to
pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that
the men went out whither the men went I wot not pursue after them
quickly; for ye shall overtake them.

 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them
with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.

 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords
and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut
the gate.

 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
roof;  And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given
you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the
inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea
for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings
of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,
whom ye utterly destroyed.

 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you
for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth
beneath.

 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my
father's house, and give me a true token  And that ye will save
alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and
all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.

 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the
land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

 Then she let them down by a cord through the window for her
house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the
pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way.

 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
oath which thou hast made us swear.

 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of
scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou
shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy
father's household, home unto thee.

 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will
be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood
shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.

 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent
them away, and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the
window.

 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three
days, until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them
throughout all the way, but found them not.

 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all
things that befell them  And they said unto Joshua, Truly the
LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the
inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and
lodged there before they passed over.

 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
through the host;  And they commanded the people, saying, When ye
see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the
Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
it.

 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
cubits by measure come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by
which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore.

 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves for to
morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the
covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of
the covenant, and went before the people.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify
thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was
with Moses, so I will be with thee.

 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of
Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear
the words of the LORD your God.

 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and
the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
passeth over before you into Jordan.

 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
out of every tribe a man.

 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth,
shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be
cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall
stand upon an heap.

 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to
pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
before the people;  And as they that bare the ark were come unto
Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in
the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
time of harvest,)  That the waters which came down from above
stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is
beside Zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off and the people passed
over right against Jericho.

 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed
clean over Jordan.

 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over
Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,  Take you twelve
men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,  And command ye
them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the
place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall
carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where
ye shall lodge this night.

 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
children of Israel, out of every tribe a man  And Joshua said unto
them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of
Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder,
according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel 
That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their
fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  
Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off
before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over
Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off and these stones shall be
for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.

 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto
Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of
Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they
lodged, and laid them down there.

 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant
stood and they are there unto this day.

 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak
unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua and the
people hasted and passed over.

 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,
that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence
of the people.

 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the
tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as
Moses spake unto them  About forty thousand prepared for war
passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.

 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,  Command the priests
that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.

 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
Jordan.

 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the
soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the
waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his
banks, as they did before.

 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean
these stones?   Then ye shall let your children know, saying,
Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before
you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red
sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over 
That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that
it is mighty that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.

 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up
the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were
passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them
any more, because of the children of Israel.

 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,
and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.

 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise All the people
that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died
in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

 Now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the
people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth
out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt,
were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD unto
whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the
LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that
floweth with milk and honey.

 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
circumcised for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
circumcised them by the way.

 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were
whole.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is
called Gilgal unto this day.

 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of
Jericho.

 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.

 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any
more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against
him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him, and
said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?   And he
said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And
Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto
him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?   And the captain of the
LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for
the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.

 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
Israel none went out, and none came in.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.

 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
rams' horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven
times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with
the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the
people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall
fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight
before him.

 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,
Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven
trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and
let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that
the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on
before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the
covenant of the LORD followed them.

 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on,
and blowing with the trumpets.

 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,
nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out
of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.

 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once
and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the
ark of the LORD.

 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets
and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the
ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
into the camp so they did six days.

 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same
manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven
times.

 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD
hath given you the city.

 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
therein, to the LORD only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all
that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we
sent.

 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest
ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and
make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
consecrated unto the LORD they shall come into the treasury of the
LORD.

 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets
and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down
flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight
before him, and they took the city.

 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the
sword.

 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman,
and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,
and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she
had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the
camp of Israel.

 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein only
the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they
put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto
this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out
Jericho.

 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho he
shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest
son shall he set up the gates of it.

 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout
all the country.

 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
thing for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of
Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing and the
anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.

 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,
on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the
country.

And the men went up and viewed Ai.

 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but
few.

 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men
and they fled before the men of Ai.

 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they
chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in
the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became
as water.

 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of
Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the
Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt
on the other side Jordan!   O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel
turneth their backs before their enemies!   For the Canaanites and
all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us
round, and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto
thy great name?   And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up;
wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?   Israel hath sinned, and
they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them for
they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and
dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.

 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they
were accursed neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy
the accursed from among you.

 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed
thing in the midst of thee, O Israel thou canst not stand before
thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.

 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
tribes and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall
come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD
shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD
shall take shall come man by man.

 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath because he hath
transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought
folly in Israel.

 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken  And he brought
the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites and he
brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken
 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was
taken.

 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to
the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now
what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against
the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done  When I saw
among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels
of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted
them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the
midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them
unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out
before the LORD.

 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,
and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his
tent, and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of
Achor.

 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and
burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So
the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name
of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed
take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai see, I
have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,
and his land  And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst
unto Jericho and her king only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush
for the city behind it.

 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai
and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent
them away by night.

 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
against the city, even behind the city go not very far from the city,
but be ye all ready  And I, and all the people that are with me,
will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass, when they come
out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 
(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the
city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first
therefore we will flee before them.

 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city
for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set
the city on fire according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye
do. See, I have commanded you.

 Joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush,
and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai but Joshua
lodged that night among the people.

 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,
and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the
north side of Ai now there was a valley between them and Ai.

 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on
the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the
city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to
battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
city.

 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
after them and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from
the city.

 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out
after Israel and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in
thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua
stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.

 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as
soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city,
and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.

 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,
the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to
flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness
turned back upon the pursuers.

 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
and slew the men of Ai.

 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side and
they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all
the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they
chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,
until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,
and smote it with the edge of the sword.

 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he
commanded Joshua.

 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
desolation unto this day.

 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as
soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his
carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of
the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth
unto this day.

 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount
Ebal,  As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of
whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron and they
offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace
offerings.

 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the
Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the
stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against
mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the
servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the
people of Israel.

 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.

 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and
the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the
great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the
Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and
with Israel, with one accord.

 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
Jericho and to Ai,  They did work wilily, and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and
wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;  And old shoes and
clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread
of their provision was dry and mouldy.

 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country now
therefore make ye a league with us.

 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
among us; and how shall we make a league with you?   And they said
unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are
ye? and from whence come ye?   And they said unto him, From a very
far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy
God for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,
which was at Ashtaroth.

 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake
to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet
them, and say unto them, We are your servants therefore now make ye a
league with us.

 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and
it is mouldy  And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were
new; and, behold, they be rent and these our garments and our shoes
are become old by reason of the very long journey.

 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
mouth of the LORD.

 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to
let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.

 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours,
and that they dwelt among them.

 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities
on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and
Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of
the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And
all the congregation murmured against the princes.

 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn
unto them by the LORD God of Israel now therefore we may not touch
them.

 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath
be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.

 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the
princes had promised them.

 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when
ye dwell among us?   Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall
none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the house of my God.

 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to
give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
you, and have done this thing.

 And now, behold, we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and
right unto thee to do unto us, do.

 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this
day, in the place which he should choose.

 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard
how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done
to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how
the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among
them;  That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,
as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and
all the men thereof were mighty.

 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of
Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of
Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,  Come up unto me,
and help me, that we may smite Gibeon for it hath made peace with
Joshua and with the children of Israel.

 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king
of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all
their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.

 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,
and save us, and help us for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell
in the mountains are gathered together against us.

 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not for I have
delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand
before thee.

 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal
all night.

 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with
a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth
up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.

 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones
from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died they were more which
died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with
the sword.

 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered
up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the
sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in
the valley of Ajalon.

 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the
book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and
hasted not to go down about a whole day.

 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man for the LORD fought for
Israel.

 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.

 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
Makkedah.

 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in
a cave at Makkedah.

 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
and set men by it for to keep them  And stay ye not, but pursue
after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to
enter into their cities for the LORD your God hath delivered them
into your hand.

 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they
were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into
fenced cities.

 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
those five kings unto me out of the cave.

 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out
of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto
the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put
your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put
their feet upon the necks of them.

 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
and of good courage for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies
against whom ye fight.

 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them
on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.

 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast
them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in
the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.

 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of
the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all
the souls that were therein; he let none remain and he did to the
king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.

 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
Libnah, and fought against Libnah  And the LORD delivered it
also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it
with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he
let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto
the king of Jericho.

 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it  And the
LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the
second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.

 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.

 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it  And
they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,
according to all that he had done to Lachish.

 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
Hebron; and they fought against it  And they took it, and smote
it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the
cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none
remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed
it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.

 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
fought against it  And he took it, and the king thereof, and all
the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,
and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none
remaining as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the
king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.

 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings he left none
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
Israel commanded.

 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all
the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.

 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of
Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,  And to the kings that were
on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth,
and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,  And to
the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the
Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to
the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with
horses and chariots very many.

 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.

 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them for
to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before
Israel thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with
fire.

 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and
unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they
left them none remaining.

 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him he houghed their
horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
the king thereof with the sword for Hazor beforetime was the head of
all those kingdoms.

 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of
the sword, utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe
and he burnt Hazor with fire.

 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he
utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.

 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel
burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.

 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children
of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote
with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither
left they any to breathe.

 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD
commanded Moses.

 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,
and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;  Even
from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the
valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon and all their kings he took, and
smote them, and slew them.

 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon all other they
took in battle.

 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should
come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and
that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the
LORD commanded Moses.

 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the
mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel Joshua
destroyed them utterly with their cities.

 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
of Israel only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel
according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from
war.

 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the
rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the
plain on the east  Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in
Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river
Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even
unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto
the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to
Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah  And the
coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants,
that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,  And reigned in mount
Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the
Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon
king of Heshbon.

 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel
smite and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto
the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad
in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to
Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession
according to their divisions;  In the mountains, and in the
valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,
and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the
Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites  The
king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;  The
king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;  The king of
Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;  The king of Debir, one; the
king of Geder, one;  The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad,
one;  The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;  The king of
Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;  The king of Aphek, one;
the king of Lasharon, one;  The king of Madon, one; the king of
Hazor, one;  The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph,
one;  The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;  The
king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of
Gilgal, one;  The king of Tirzah, one all the kings thirty and
one.

 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto
him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very
much land to be possessed.

 This is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the
Philistines, and all Geshuri,  From Sihor, which is before Egypt,
even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the
Canaanite five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the
Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also
the Avites  From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and
Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
Amorites  And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward
the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into
Hamath.

 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from
before the children of Israel only divide thou it by lot unto the
Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,  With whom the Reubenites
and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave
them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD
gave them;  From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon,
and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
Medeba unto Dibon;  And all the cities of Sihon king of the
Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of
Ammon;  And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and
Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 
All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in
Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did Moses
smite, and cast them out.

 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,
nor the Maachathites but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell
among the Israelites until this day.

 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
inheritance, as he said unto them.

 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
inheritance according to their families.

 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the
plain by Medeba;  Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the
plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,  And Jahaza, and
Kedemoth, and Mephaath,  And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and
Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,  And Bethpeor, and
Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,  And all the cities of the
plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi,
and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon,
dwelling in the country.

 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of
Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.

 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben
after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.

 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
children of Gad according to their families.

 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before
Rabbah;  And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and
from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;  And in the valley,
Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the
kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the
edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
families, the cities, and their villages.

 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh and
this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh
by their families.

 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan,
threescore cities  And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei,
cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the
children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
children of Machir by their families.

 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by
Jericho, eastward.

 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance the
LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.

 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the
children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.

 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand
of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
tribe on the other side Jordan but unto the Levites he gave none
inheritance among them.

 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim
therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities
to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their
substance.

 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and
they divided the land.

 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal and Caleb
the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the
thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and
thee in Kadeshbarnea.

 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me
from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again
as it was in mine heart.

 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of
the people melt but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy
feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for
ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.

 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these
forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses,
while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now, lo,
I am this day fourscore and five years old.

 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
sent me as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
both to go out, and to come in.

 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there,
and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the LORD will be
with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.

 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Hebron for an inheritance.

 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed
the LORD God of Israel.

 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a
great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin
southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from
the bay that looketh southward  And it went out to the south side
to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the
south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up
to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa  From thence it passed
toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out
of that coast were at the sea this shall be your south coast.

 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
Jordan.

And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at
the uttermost part of Jordan  And the border went up to
Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border
went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben  And the border
went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward,
looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which
is on the south side of the river and the border passed toward the
waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel 
And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem and the border went
up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom
westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward
 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount
Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim
 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on
the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah
 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward and
the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and
went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the
sea.

 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.

This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to
their families.

 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,
even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.

 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir and the name
of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to
him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it and
he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to
ask of her father a field and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said
unto her, What wouldest thou?   Who answered, Give me a blessing;
for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.
And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
according to their families.

 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,  And Kedesh, and Hazor,
and Ithnan,  Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,  And Hazor,
Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,  Amam, and
Shema, and Moladah,  And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,
 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,  Baalah, and
Iim, and Azem,  And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,  And
Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,  And Lebaoth, and Shilhim,
and Ain, and Rimmon all the cities are twenty and nine, with their
villages  And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,
 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,  Jarmuth, and
Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,  And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and
Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages 
Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,  And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and
Joktheel,  Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,  And Cabbon, and
Lahmam, and Kithlish,  And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and
Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages  Libnah, and Ether,
and Ashan,  And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,  And Keilah,
and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages 
Ekron, with her towns and her villages  From Ekron even unto the
sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages  Ashdod with
her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto
the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof 
And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,  And Dannah,
and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,  And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and
Anim,  And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
villages  Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,  And Janum, and
Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,  And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is
Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages  Maon, Carmel,
and Ziph, and Juttah,  And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages 
Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,  And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and
Eltekon; six cities with their villages  Kirjathbaal, which is
Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages  In
the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,  And Nibshan,
and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.

 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the
children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that
goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,  And goeth out from
Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast
of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are
at the sea.

 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
inheritance.

 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east
side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;  And the border
went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the
border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the
east to Janohah;  And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to
Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of
the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.

 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their
villages.

 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer but
the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve
under tribute.

 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the
father of Gilead because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead
and Bashan.

 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of
Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of
Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of
Shemida these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by
their families.

 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters and these are
the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and
Tirzah.

 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded
Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore
according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance
among the brethren of their father.

 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;  Because
the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the
rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto
the inhabitants of Entappuah.

 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah but Tappuah on the border
of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;  And the coast
descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river these cities
of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh the coast of Manasseh
also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were
at the sea  Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was
Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher
on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns, even three countries.

 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly
drive them out.

 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a
great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  
And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up
to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the
Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.

 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us
and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have
chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and
they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power
thou shalt not have one lot only  But the mountain shall be
thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings
of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though
they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation
there. And the land was subdued before them.

 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
which had not yet received their inheritance.

 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers
hath given you?   Give out from among you three men for each
tribe and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the
land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
shall come again to me.

 And they shall divide it into seven parts Judah shall abide in
their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their
coasts on the north.

 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring
the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before
the LORD our God.

 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
LORD is their inheritance and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of
Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,
which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.

 And the men arose, and went away and Joshua charged them that
went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and
describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you
before the LORD in Shiloh.

 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by
cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the
host at Shiloh.

 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD and
there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to
their divisions.

 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
according to their families and the coast of their lot came forth
between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up
through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the
wilderness of Bethaven.

 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of
Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to
Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether
Bethhoron.

 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the
sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward;
and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is
Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah this was the west
quarter.

 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the
border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of
Nephtoah  And the border came down to the end of the mountain
that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of
Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,
 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of
Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 
And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and
went down unto Arabah  And the border passed along to the side
of Bethhoglah northward and the outgoings of the border were at the
north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan this was the
south coast.

 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round
about, according to their families.

 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the
valley of Keziz,  And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, 
And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,  And Chepharhaammonai, and
Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages  Gibeon, and

And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,  And Zelah, Eleph, and
Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with
their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin
according to their families.

 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
the children of Simeon according to their families and their
inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
Moladah,  And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,  And Eltolad,
and Bethul, and Hormah,  And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and
Hazarsusah,  And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and
their villages  Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities
and their villages  And all the villages that were round about
these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families.

 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance
of the children of Simeon for the part of the children of Judah was
too much for them therefore the children of Simeon had their
inheritance within the inheritance of them.

 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
to their families and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid
 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
Jokneam;  And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising
unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
goeth up to Japhia,  And from thence passeth on along on the east
to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to
Neah;  And the border compasseth it on the north side to
Hannathon and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel
 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
Bethlehem twelve cities with their villages.

 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to
their families, these cities with their villages.

 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
Issachar according to their families.

 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,  And Rabbith, and
Kishion, and Abez,  And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and
Bethpazzez;  And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan sixteen
cities with their villages.

 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
according to their families, the cities and their villages.

 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
Asher according to their families.

 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
westward, and to Shihorlibnath;  And turneth toward the sunrising
to Bethdagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel
toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul
on the left hand,  And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah,
even unto great Zidon;  And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and
to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the
outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib  Ummah
also, and Aphek, and Rehob twenty and two cities with their villages.

 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
according to their families, these cities with their villages.

 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the
children of Naphtali according to their families.

 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were
at Jordan  And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor,
and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon
Jordan toward the sunrising.

 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and
Chinnereth,  And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,  And Kedesh,
and Edrei, and Enhazor,  And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and
Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
according to their families, the cities and their villages.

 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
Dan according to their families.

 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
Irshemesh,  And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,  And
Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,  And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and
Baalath,  And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,  And
Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
them therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem,
and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed
it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan
their father.

 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
according to their families, these cities with their villages.

 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua
the son of Nun among them  According to the word of the LORD
they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount
Ephraim and he built the city, and dwelt therein.

 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the
children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before
the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they
made an end of dividing the country.

 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,  Speak to the
children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge,
whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses  That the slayer
that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and
they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand
at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause
in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the
city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.

 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that
shall be in those days then shall the slayer return, and come unto
his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he
fled.

 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the
mountain of Judah.

 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned
Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and
Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of
the tribe of Manasseh.

 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel,
and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever
killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the
hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads
of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;  And they
spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD
commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the
suburbs thereof for our cattle.

 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their
suburbs.

 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites and the
children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot
out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of
the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out
of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the
tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe
of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen
cities.

 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of
Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun,
twelve cities.

 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out
of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here
mentioned by name.

 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had for theirs was the
first lot.

 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof
round about it.

 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they
to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with
her suburbs,  And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her
suburbs,  And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.

 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba
with her suburbs,  Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her
suburbs; four cities.

 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
thirteen cities with their suburbs.

 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their
lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to
be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 
And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four
cities.

 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon
with her suburbs,  Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her
suburbs; four cities.

 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs,
and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
the children of Kohath that remained.

 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in
Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and
Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
Dabareh with her suburbs,  Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim
with her suburbs; four cities.

 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
with her suburbs,  Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her
suburbs; four cities.

 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with
her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the
Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and
Kartah with her suburbs,  Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with
her suburbs; four cities.

 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
Jahazah with her suburbs,  Kedemoth with her suburbs, and
Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.

 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,
 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in
all.

 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,
which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot
twelve cities.

 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.

 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them
thus were all these cities.

 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.

 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their
enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their
hand.

 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
tribe of Manasseh,  And said unto them, Ye have kept all that
Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice
in all that I commanded you  Ye have not left your brethren these
many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment
of the LORD your God.

 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as
he promised them therefore now return ye, and get you unto your
tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant
of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which
Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God,
and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to
cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
your soul.

 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away and they went unto
their tents.

 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
possession in Bashan but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua
among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua
sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,  And
he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents,
and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass,
and with iron, and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your
enemies with your brethren.

 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel
out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country
of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were
possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar
to see to.

 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have
built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of
Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at
Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and
to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the
land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,  And with
him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the
tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their
fathers among the thousands of Israel.

 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,
and they spake with them, saying,  Thus saith the whole
congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed
against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the
LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this
day against the LORD?   Is the iniquity of Peor too little for
us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was
a plague in the congregation of the LORD,  But that ye must turn
away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel
to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the
whole congregation of Israel.

 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then
pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the
LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us but rebel
not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar
beside the altar of the LORD our God.

 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
perished not alone in his iniquity.

 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands
of Israel,  The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he
knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)  That we
have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer
thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace
offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;  And if we
have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to
come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye
to do with the LORD God of Israel?   For the LORD hath made
Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children
of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD so shall your children make our
children cease from fearing the LORD.

 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not
for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice  But that it may be a
witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we
might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings,
and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your
children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part
in the LORD.

 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to
us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again,
Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made,
not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness
between us and you.

 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this
day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings,
for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD
our God that is before his tabernacle.

 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him,
heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.

 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of
Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye
have not committed this trespass against the LORD now ye have
delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.

 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad,
out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of
Israel, and brought them word again.

 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in
battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad
dwelt.

 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
altar Ed for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.

 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed
old and stricken in age.

 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for
their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said
unto them, I am old and stricken in age  And ye have seen all
that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of
you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.

 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,
to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the
nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.

 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and
drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as
the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside
therefrom to the right hand or to the left;  That ye come not
among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention
of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve
them, nor bow yourselves unto them  But cleave unto the LORD your
God, as ye have done unto this day.

 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
strong but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto
this day.

 One man of you shall chase a thousand for the LORD your God, he
it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD
your God.

 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make
marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you  Know
for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of
these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto
you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye
perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth and
ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing
hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake
concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath
failed thereof.

 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD
bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off
this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed
yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled
against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which
he hath given unto you.

 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their
judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before
God.

 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time,
even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor and they
served other gods.

 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his
seed, and gave him Isaac.

 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave unto Esau mount
Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.

 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
that which I did among them and afterward I brought you out.

 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt and ye came unto the
sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and
horsemen unto the Red sea.

 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them;
and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt and ye dwelt in the
wilderness a long season.

 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on
the other side Jordan; and they fought with you and I gave them into
your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from
before you.

 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse
you  But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed
you still so I delivered you out of his hand.

 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho and the men of
Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and
the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy
sword, nor with thy bow.

 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other
side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this
day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites,
in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house, we will serve the
LORD.

 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;  For the LORD our God, he
it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt,
from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our
sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all
the people through whom we passed  And the LORD drave out from
before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land
therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.

 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD for
he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your
transgressions nor your sins.

 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you
good.

 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
LORD.

 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they
said, We are witnesses.

 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,
and his voice will we obey.

 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them
a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and
took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the
sanctuary of the LORD.

 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which
he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye
deny your God.

 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.

 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years
old.

 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill
of Gaash.

 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the
works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up
out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which
Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred
pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of
Joseph.

 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill
that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount
Ephraim.




The Book of Judges


 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children
of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the
Canaanites first, to fight against them?   And the LORD said, Judah
shall go up behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.

 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my
lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go
with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.

 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
Perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in Bezek ten
thousand men.

 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek and they fought against him,
and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,
and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table as I
have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,
and there he died.

 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had
taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city
on fire.

 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the
valley.

 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now
the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba) and they slew Sheshai, and
Ahiman, and Talmai.

 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir and the
name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher  And Caleb said, He that
smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my
daughter to wife.

 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it
and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to
ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb
said unto her, What wilt thou?   And she said unto him, Give me a
blessing for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of
water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.

 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out
of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the
wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went
and dwelt among the people.

 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the
name of the city was called Hormah.

 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of
the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
because they had chariots of iron.

 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said and he expelled
thence the three sons of Anak.

 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel and
the LORD was with them.

 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of
the city before was Luz.)   And the spies saw a man come forth out
of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the
entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.

 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all
his family.

 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
and called the name thereof Luz which is the name thereof unto this
day.

 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and
her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and
her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the
inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell
in that land.

 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;
but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and
became tributaries.

 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor
of Aphik, nor of Rehob  But the Asherites dwelt among the
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them
out.

 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites,
the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of
Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.

 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain
for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley  But
the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim
yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became
tributaries.

 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,
from the rock, and upward.

 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,
I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land
which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my
covenant with you.

 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye
shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why
have ye done this?   Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them
out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and
their gods shall be a snare unto you.

 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words
unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their
voice, and wept.

 And they called the name of that place Bochim and they sacrificed
there unto the LORD.

 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went
every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great
works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an
hundred and ten years old.

 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill
Gaash.

 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers
and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the
LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
served Baalim  And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,
which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,
of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he
sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they
could not any longer stand before their enemies.

 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto
them and they were greatly distressed.

 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out
of the hand of those that spoiled them.

 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them they turned
quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the
commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.

 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with
the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the
days of the judge for it repented the LORD because of their groanings
by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,
and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other
gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from
their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.

 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;  I
also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations
which Joshua left when he died  That through them I may prove
Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as
their fathers did keep it, or not.

 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out
hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by
them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to
teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the
Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount
Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their
fathers by the hand of Moses.

 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,
and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites  And they
took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to
their sons, and served their gods.

 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.

 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia and
the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.

 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them,
even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel,
and went out to war and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of
Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against
Chushanrishathaim.

 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
died.

 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
LORD and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,
because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
years.

 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man
lefthanded and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto
Eglon the king of Moab.

 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab and Eglon was
a very fat man.

 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
the people that bare the present.

 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king who said,
Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from
God unto thee.

And he arose out of his seat.

 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
right thigh, and thrust it into his belly  And the haft also went
in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he
could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
parlour upon him, and locked them.

 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he
covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

 And they tarried till they were ashamed and, behold, he opened
not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened
them and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.

 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in
the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him
from the mount, and he before them.

 And he said unto them, Follow after me for the LORD hath
delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down
after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not
a man to pass over.

 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
land had rest fourscore years.

 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered
Israel.

 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
LORD, when Ehud was dead.

 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in
Harosheth of the Gentiles.

 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD for he had nine
hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
children of Israel.

 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel
at that time.

 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
Bethel in mount Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her for
judgment.

 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel
commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun?   And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera,
the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and
I will deliver him into thine hand.

 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go
but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

 And she said, I will surely go with thee notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and
went with Barak to Kedesh.

 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
with ten thousand men at his feet and Deborah went up with him.

 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and
pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.

 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
to mount Tabor.

 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from
Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the
LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand is not the LORD gone out
before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men
after him.

 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera
lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
Harosheth of the Gentiles and all the host of Sisera fell upon the
edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife
of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin the king of
Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into
the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him
drink, and covered him.

 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is
there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into
his temples, and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep
and weary. So he died.

 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and
the nail was in his temples.

 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
children of Israel.

 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king
of Canaan.

 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
saying,  Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the
people willingly offered themselves.

 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of
the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the
clouds also dropped water.

 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from
before the LORD God of Israel.

 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.

 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates was there a shield
or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?   My heart is toward
the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the
people. Bless ye the LORD.

 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and
walk by the way.

 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the
LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages
in Israel then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.

 Awake, awake, Deborah awake, awake, utter a song arise, Barak,
and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
among the people the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.

 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors,
and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and
also Barak he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of
Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of
the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of
heart.

 Gilead abode beyond Jordan and why did Dan remain in ships?
Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
unto the death in the high places of the field.

 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
against Sisera.

 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
the pransings of their mighty ones.

 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the
inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to
the help of the LORD against the mighty.

 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter
in a lordly dish.

 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's
hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,
when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.

 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down at her feet he bowed,
he fell where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the
wheels of his chariots?   Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she
returned answer to herself,  Have they not sped? have they not
divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of
divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers
colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that
take the spoil?   So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD but let
them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
the land had rest forty years.

 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and
the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.

 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of
the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in
the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up
against them;  And they encamped against them, and destroyed the
increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no
sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came
as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were
without number and they entered into the land to destroy it.

 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and
the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the
LORD because of the Midianites,  That the LORD sent a prophet unto
the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God
of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
the house of bondage;  And I delivered you out of the hand of the
Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave
them out from before you, and gave you their land;  And I said
unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites,
in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice.

 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which
was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite and his son
Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the
Midianites.

 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,
The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our
fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?
but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of
the Midianites.

 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and
thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites have not I
sent thee?   And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I
save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
least in my father's house.

 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou
shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring
forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry
until thou come again.

 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of
an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth
in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.

 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.
And he did so.

 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and
there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the
unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his
sight.

 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the
LORD face to face.

 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not thou
shalt not die.

 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
Jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven
years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and
cut down the grove that is by it  And build an altar unto the
LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take
the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the
grove which thou shalt cut down.

 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had
said unto him and so it was, because he feared his father's
household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day,
that he did it by night.

 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was
by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was
built.

 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when
they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done
this thing.

 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that
he may die because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because
he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for
Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to
death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god, let him plead for
himself, because one hath cast down his altar.

 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the
valley of Jezreel.

 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
gathered after him and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto
Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,
as thou hast said,  Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the
floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all
the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
hand, as thou hast said.

 And it was so for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the
fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of
water.

 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me,
and I will speak but this once let me prove, I pray thee, but this
once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon
all the ground let there be dew.

 And God did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only,
and there was dew on all the ground.

 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with
him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod so that the
host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of
Moreh, in the valley.

 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are
too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel
vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.

 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from
mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two
thousand; and there remained ten thousand.

 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring
them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there and it
shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the
same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall
not go with thee, the same shall not go.

 So he brought down the people unto the water and the LORD said
unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a
dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that
boweth down upon his knees to drink.

 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their
mouth, were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed
down upon their knees to drink water.

 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand
and let all the other people go every man unto his place.

 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets and
he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained
those three hundred men and the host of Midian was beneath him in the
valley.

 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine
hand.

 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down
to the host  And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward
shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went
he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that
were in the host.

 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and
their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for
multitude.

 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a
cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a
tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay
along.

 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the
sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel for into his hand
hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the
host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your
hand the host of Midian.

 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he
put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps
within the pitchers.

 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise and, behold,
when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so
shall ye do.

 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow
ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword
of the LORD, and of Gideon.

 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had
but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets, and brake the
pitchers that were in their hands.

 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in
their right hands to blow withal and they cried, The sword of the
LORD, and of Gideon.

 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and
all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every
man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host and the
host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of
Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after
the Midianites.

 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,
come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto
Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves
together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and
they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress
of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
Gideon on the other side Jordan.

 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the
Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.

 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage
of Abiezer?   God hath delivered into your hands the princes of
Midian, Oreb and Zeeb and what was I able to do in comparison of you?
Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of
bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am
pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns
of the wilderness and with briers.

 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise and
the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.

 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
again in peace, I will break down this tower.

 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,
about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the
children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand
men that drew sword.

 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was
secure.

 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took
the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the
host.

 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun
was up,  And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and
enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and
the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and
Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah
and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men
that are weary?   And he took the elders of the city, and thorns
of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
Succoth.

 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
city.

 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were
they; each one resembled the children of a king.

 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother
as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.

 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the
youth drew not his sword for he feared, because he was yet a youth.

 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us for as
the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and
Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels'
necks.

 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both
thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also for thou hast delivered us
from the hand of Midian.

 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
shall my son rule over you the LORD shall rule over you.

 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that
ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had
golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)   And they
answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and
did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.

 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and
collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and
beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.

 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
Ophrah and all Israel went thither a whoring after it which thing
became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness
forty years in the days of Gideon.

 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.

 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for
he had many wives.

 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,
whose name he called Abimelech.

 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
Abiezrites.

 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and
made Baalberith their god.

 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who
had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every
side  Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto
Israel.

 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of
the house of his mother's father, saying,  Speak, I pray you, in
the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either
that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons,
reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am
your bone and your flesh.

 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men
of Shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow
Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the
house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,
which followed him.

 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon
one stone notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal
was left; for he hid himself.

 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of
Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar
that was in Shechem.

 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of
mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them,
Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.

 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over
the trees?   And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and
reign over us.

 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,
and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?   Then
said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.

 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?   Then
said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.

 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not,
let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and
his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his
hands;  (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life
far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian  And ye are
risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons,
threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech,
the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he
is your brother;)  If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with
Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech,
and let him also rejoice in you  But if not, let fire come out
from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo;
and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of
Millo, and devour Abimelech.

 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,
for fear of Abimelech his brother.

 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,  Then God
sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the
men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech  That the
cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come,
and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them;
and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his
brethren.

 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them
and it was told Abimelech.

 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
Shechem and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.

 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,
and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their
god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and
Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem for
why should we serve him?   And would to God this people were under
my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech,
Increase thine army, and come out.

 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the
son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold,
they fortify the city against thee.

 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,
and lie in wait in the field  And it shall be, that in the
morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon
the city and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come
out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find
occasion.

 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of
the gate of the city and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were
with him, from lying in wait.

 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto
him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.

 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the
middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of
Meonenim.

 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou
saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the
people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with
them.

 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
Abimelech.

 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were
overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.

 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into
the field; and they told Abimelech.

 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were
come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote
them.

 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,
and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other
companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew
them.

 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the
city, and sowed it with salt.

 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
Shechem were gathered together.

 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut
down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder,
and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do,
make haste, and do as I have done.

 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire
upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also,
about a thousand men and women.

 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and
took it.

 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them,
and gat them up to the top of the tower.

 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's
head, and all to brake his skull.

 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and
said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A
women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.

 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
departed every man unto his place.

 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto
his father, in slaying his seventy brethren  And all the evil of
the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads and upon them came
the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of
Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in
mount Ephraim.

 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
buried in Shamir.

 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty
and two years.

 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which
are in the land of Gilead.

 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the
gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of
Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and
served not him.

 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the
children of Ammon.

 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel
eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side
Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.

 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also
against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim;
so that Israel was sore distressed.

 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have
sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also
served Baalim.

 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver
you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of
Ammon, and from the Philistines?   The Zidonians also, and the
Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and
I delivered you out of their hand.

 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods wherefore I will
deliver you no more.

 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver
you in the time of your tribulation.

 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned
do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we
pray thee, this day.

 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
the LORD and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together,
and encamped in Mizpeh.

 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he
shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was
the son of an harlot and Gilead begat Jephthah.

 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and
they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in
our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.

 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
Tob and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with
him.

 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
Ammon made war against Israel.

 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against
Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of
Tob  And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that
we may fight with the children of Ammon.

 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,
and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now
when ye are in distress?   And the elders of Gilead said unto
Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go
with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over
all the inhabitants of Gilead.

 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver
them before me, shall I be your head?   And the elders of Gilead
said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so
according to thy words.

 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
made him head and captain over them and Jephthah uttered all his
words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come
against me to fight in my land?   And the king of the children of
Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took
away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto
Jabbok, and unto Jordan now therefore restore those lands again
peaceably.

 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children
of Ammon  And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took
not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon
 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;  Then Israel
sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee,
pass through thy land but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.
And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab but he would not
consent and Israel abode in Kadesh.

 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the
land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not
within the border of Moab for Arnon was the border of Moab.

 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the
king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,
through thy land into my place.

 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast but
Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and
fought against Israel.

 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
into the hand of Israel, and they smote them so Israel possessed all
the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?  
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before
us, them will we possess.

 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor,
king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight
against them,  While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and
in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the
coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover
them within that time?   Wherefore I have not sinned against
thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me the LORD the Judge be
judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of
Ammon.

 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the
words of Jephthah which he sent him.

 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from
Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.

 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt
without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,  Then
it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to
meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall
surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.

 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very
great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the
children of Israel.

 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she
was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.

 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,
and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou
art one of them that trouble me for I have opened my mouth unto the
LORD, and I cannot go back.

 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth
unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of
thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of
thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.

 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me let
me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and
bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months and she
went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
mountains.

 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned
unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had
vowed and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,  That
the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah
the Gileadite four days in a year.

 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to
fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with
thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.

 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife
with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not
out of their hands.

 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD
delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me
this day, to fight against me?   Then Jephthah gathered together
all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim and the men of Gilead
smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of
Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
Ephraimites and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were
escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him,
Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;  Then said they unto him,
Say now Shibboleth and he said Sibboleth for he could not frame to
pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages
of Jordan and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and
two thousand.

 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he
judged Israel seven years.

 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
Israel ten years.

 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
country of Zebulun.

 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
Israel.

 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
threescore and ten ass colts and he judged Israel eight years.

 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried
in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines
forty years.

 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.

 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto
her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not but thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son.

 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
drink, and eat not any unclean thing  For, lo, thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head for the
child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin
to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel
of God, very terrible but I asked him not whence he was, neither told
he me his name  But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive,
and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat
any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the
womb to the day of his death.

 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man
of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we
shall do unto the child that shall be born.

 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but Manoah her
husband was not with her.

 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto
me the other day.

 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,
and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And
he said, I am.

 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
order the child, and how shall we do unto him?   And the angel of
the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her
beware.

 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing all
that I commanded her let her observe.

 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us
detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
me, I will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt
offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that
he was an angel of the LORD.

 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?   And
the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my
name, seeing it is secret?   So Manoah took a kid with a meat
offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD and the angel did
wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.

 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the
altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces
to the ground.

 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
have seen God.

 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,
he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our
hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as
at this time have told us such things as these.

 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson and the
child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
the daughters of the Philistines.

 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I
have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines now
therefore get her for me to wife.

 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people,
that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And
Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD,
that he sought an occasion against the Philistines for at that time
the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,
and came to the vineyards of Timnath and, behold, a young lion roared
against him.

 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand but
he told not his father or his mother what he had done.

 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
Samson well.

 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to
see the carcase of the lion and, behold, there was a swarm of bees
and honey in the carcase of the lion.

 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to
his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat but he told
not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

 So his father went down unto the woman and Samson made there a
feast; for so used the young men to do.

 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
companions to be with him.

 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the
feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty
change of garments  But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall
ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said
unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out
of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days
expound the riddle.

 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the
riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire have ye
called us to take that we have? is it not so?   And Samson's wife
wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not
thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast
not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my
father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?   And she wept
before him the seven days, while their feast lasted and it came to
pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon
him and she told the riddle to the children of her people.

 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before
the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger
than a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my
heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave
change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger
was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
as his friend.

 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will
go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him
to go in.

 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion is not her younger
sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.

 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst
between two tails.

 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and
also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.

 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,
and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt
her and her father with fire.

 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I
be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
themselves in Lehi.

 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath
done to us.

 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are
rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said
unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.

 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said
unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,
and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee.
And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the
rock.

 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him
and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that
were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his
bands loosed from off his hands.

 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place
Ramathlehi.

 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou
hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and
now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the
uncircumcised?   But God clave an hollow place that was in the
jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit
came again, and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof
Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
years.

 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
unto her.

 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And
they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of
the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when
it is day, we shall kill him.

 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with
them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them
up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.

 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto
her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what
means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him;
and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict
thee.

 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs
that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
chamber.

And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the
fire. So his strength was not known.

 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be
bound.

 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were
liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his
arms like a thread.

 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said
unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.

 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and
went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.

 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and
hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,
and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;  That he
told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor
upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's
womb if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall
become weak, and be like any other man.

 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this
once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the
Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.

 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man,
and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she
began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before,
and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.

 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought
him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did
grind in the prison house.

 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
shaven.

 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to
offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice for they
said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.

 And when the people saw him, they praised their god for they
said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for
Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport and they set
him between the pillars.

 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I
may lean upon them.

 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three
thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.

 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember
me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O
God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right
hand, and of the other with his left.

 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and
upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at
his death were more than they which he slew in his life.

 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and
took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol
in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty
years.

 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver
that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of
also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his
mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.

 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to
his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto
the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten
image now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made
thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house
of Micah.

 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that
which was right in his own eyes.

 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount Ephraim to
the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may
find a place.

 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father
and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year,
and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
man was unto him as one of his sons.

 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
priest, and was in the house of Micah.

 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

 In those days there was no king in Israel and in those days the
tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto
that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the
tribes of Israel.

 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the
land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land
who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they
lodged there.

 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
young man the Levite and they turned in thither, and said unto him,
Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what
hast thou here?   And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth
Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that
we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace before the LORD is
your way wherein ye go.

 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people
that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the
Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,
that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the
Zidonians, and had no business with any man.

 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol and their
brethren said unto them, What say ye?   And they said, Arise, that
we may go up against them for we have seen the land, and, behold, it
is very good and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to
possess the land.

 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
land for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no
want of any thing that is in the earth.

 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of
war.

 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah
wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day behold, it
is behind Kirjathjearim.

 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
house of Micah.

 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these
houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?
now therefore consider what ye have to do.

 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young
man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.

 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.

 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came
in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the
teraphim, and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering
of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons
of war.

 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image,
the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the
priest unto them, What do ye?   And they said unto him, Hold thy
peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a
father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the
house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family
in Israel?   And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the
ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst
of the people.

 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
cattle and the carriage before them.

 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together,
and overtook the children of Dan.

 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with
such a company?   And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I
made, and the priest, and ye are gone away and what have I more? and
what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?   And the
children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us,
lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the
lives of thy household.

 And the children of Dan went their way and when Micah saw that
they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.

 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet
and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt
the city with fire.

 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth
by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.

 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
their father, who was born unto Israel howbeit the name of the city
was Laish at the first.

 And the children of Dan set up the graven image and Jonathan,
the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests
to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of
mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four
whole months.

 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple
of asses and she brought him into her father's house and when the
father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he
abode with him three days so they did eat and drink, and lodged
there.

 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in
the morning, that he rose up to depart and the damsel's father said
unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and
afterward go your way.

 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together
for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray
thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.

 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him
therefore he lodged there again.

 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and
the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they
tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.

 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him,
Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all
night behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart
may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou
mayest go home.

 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there
were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.

 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in
into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into
the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will
pass over to Gibeah.

 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one
of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.

 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.

 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah
and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city for
there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.

 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in
Gibeah but the men of the place were Benjamites.

 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
the street of the city and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and
whence comest thou?   And he said unto him, We are passing from
Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I and
I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD;
and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young
man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing.

 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
asses and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and
beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man,
saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may
know him.

 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.

 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I
will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth
good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing.

 But the men would not hearken to him so the man took his
concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and
abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to
spring, they let her go.

 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at
the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.

 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
house, and went out to go his way and, behold, the woman his
concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were
upon the threshold.

 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
answered.

Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him
unto his place.

 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into
twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.

 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed
done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of
the land of Egypt unto this day consider of it, take advice, and
speak your minds.

 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the
land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,
four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us,
how was this wickedness?   And the Levite, the husband of the
woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that
belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round
about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me and my concubine
have they forced, that she is dead.

 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel for they have
committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and
counsel.

 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of
us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.

 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
will go up by lot against it;  And we will take ten men of an
hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a
thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the
people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,
according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
together as one man.

 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which
are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from
Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of
their brethren the children of Israel.

 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of
the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of
Israel.

 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the
inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.

 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not
miss.

 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war.

 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first
to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said,
Judah shall go up first.

 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
against Gibeah.

 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at
Gibeah.

 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two
thousand men.

 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set
their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in
array the first day.

 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again
to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD
said, Go up against him.)   And the children of Israel came near
against the children of Benjamin the second day.

 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again
eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the
LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and
peace offerings before the LORD.

 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of
the covenant of God was there in those days,  And Phinehas, the
son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,)
saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of
Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for
to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.

 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah,
as at other times.

 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people,
and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to
the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty
men of Israel.

 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before
us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and
draw them from the city unto the highways.

 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
themselves in array at Baaltamar and the liers in wait of Israel came
forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.

 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
Israel, and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near
them.

 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel and the children of
Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand
and an hundred men all these drew the sword.

 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten for the
men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto
the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.

 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the
edge of the sword.

 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise
up out of the city.

 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began
to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons for they
said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.

 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the
flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them.

 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto
the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them
which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.

 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,
and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the
sunrising.

 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were
men of valour.

 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
Rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men;
and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of
them.

 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.

 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men
of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand also they set
on fire all the cities that they came to.

 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;  And
said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that
there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?   And it came
to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an
altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?
For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the
LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.

 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to
wives?   And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel
that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none
to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the
inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants
of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the
children.

 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy
every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male
and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of
Canaan.

 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto
them.

 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead and yet so
they sufficed them not.

 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD
had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of
Benjamin?   And they said, There must be an inheritance for them
that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
Israel.

 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the
children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife
to Benjamin.

 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east
side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the
south of Lebonah.

 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
and lie in wait in the vineyards;  And see, and, behold, if the
daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of
the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of
Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto
us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them
for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the
war for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be
guilty.

 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught and
they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the
cities, and dwelt in them.

 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence
every man to his inheritance.

 In those days there was no king in Israel every man did that
which was right in his own eyes.



The Book of Ruth


 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there
was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to
sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued
there.

 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two
sons.

 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one
was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelled there
about ten years.

 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was
left of her two sons and her husband.

 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return
from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how
that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.

 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her
two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto
the land of Judah.

 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to
her mother's house the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt
with the dead, and with me.

 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house
of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice,
and wept.

 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
people.

 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters why will ye go with me?
are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your
husbands?   Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too
old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have
an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  Would ye
tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from
having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your
sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.

 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again and Orpah kissed
her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
people, and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law.

 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
following after thee for whither thou goest, I will go; and where
thou lodgest, I will lodge thy people shall be my people, and thy God
my God  Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried
the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and
me.

 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then
she left speaking unto her.

 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved
about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?   And she said unto
them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara for the Almighty hath dealt
very bitterly with me.

 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty
why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me,
and the Almighty hath afflicted me?   So Naomi returned, and Ruth
the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of
the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of
barley harvest.

 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find
grace.

And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging
unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,
The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.

 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
Whose damsel is this?   And the servant that was set over the
reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back
with Naomi out of the country of Moab  And she said, I pray you,
let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she
came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she
tarried a little in the house.

 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by
my maidens  Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and
go thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall
not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and
drink of that which the young men have drawn.

 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and
said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou
shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?   And Boaz
answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that
thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine
husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the
land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest
not heretofore.

 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of
the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.

 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto
thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of
the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the
reapers and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was
sufficed, and left.

 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,
saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not
 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley.

 And she took it up, and went into the city and her mother in law
saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth, and gave to her that
she had reserved after she was sufficed.

 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to
day?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge
of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought,
and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.

 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the
dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of
our next kinsmen.

 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not
in any other field.

 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.

 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I
not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?   And now is
not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he
winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.

 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon
thee, and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto
the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.

 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet,
and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.

 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that
her mother in law bade her.

 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly,
and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
turned himself and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art
a near kinsman.

 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter for thou
hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning,
inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.

 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou
requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a
virtuous woman.

 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a
kinsman nearer than I.

 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the
kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee,
then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth lie
down until the morning.

 And she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before
one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman
came into the floor.

 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold
it.

And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it
on her and she went into the city.

 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,
my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.

 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
matter will fall for the man will not be in rest, until he have
finished the thing this day.

 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there and,
behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho,
such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat
down.

 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye
down here. And they sat down.

 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the
country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother
Elimelech's  And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it
before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou
wilt redeem it, redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell
me, that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I
am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.

 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the
dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.

 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar
mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot
redeem it.

 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man
plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour and this was a
testimony in Israel.

 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew
off his shoe.

 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and
all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.

 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased
to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,
that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and
from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day.

 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,
We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine
house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of
Israel and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem
 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young
woman.

 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife and when he went in unto
her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous
in Israel.

 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher
of thine old age for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is
better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
nurse unto it.

 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a
son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed he is the father of
Jesse, the father of David.

 Now these are the generations of Pharez Pharez begat Hezron,
 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,  And Amminadab
begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,  And Salmon begat Boaz,
and Boaz begat Obed,  And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.




The First Book of Samuel

Otherwise Called

The First Book of the Kings


 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,
and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the
son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite  And he had two wives;
the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah
and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.

 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions  But
unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah but the
LORD had shut up her womb.

 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
because the LORD had shut up her womb.

 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of
the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.

 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?
and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better
to thee than ten sons?   So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat
by a post of the temple of the LORD.

 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and
wept sore.

 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and
not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man
child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,
and there shall no razor come upon his head.

 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
that Eli marked her mouth.

 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her
voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.

 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
thy wine from thee.

 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have
poured out my soul before the LORD.

 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial for out of the
abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace and the God of Israel
grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the
woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.

 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the
LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah and Elkanah knew
Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,
saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not
go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he
may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.

 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So
the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three
bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought
him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh and the child was young.

 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the
woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition
which I asked of him  Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD;
as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped
the LORD there.

 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine
horn is exalted in the LORD my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
because I rejoice in thy salvation.

 There is none holy as the LORD for there is none beside thee
neither is there any rock like our God.

 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of
your mouth for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are
weighed.

 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are
girded with strength.

 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they
that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven; and she
that hath many children is waxed feeble.

 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave,
and bringeth up.

 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich he bringeth low, and
lifteth up.

 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar
from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit
the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and
he hath set the world upon them.

 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
heaven shall he thunder upon them the LORD shall judge the ends of
the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the
horn of his anointed.

 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.

 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man
offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in
seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  And he
struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the
fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in
Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;
for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat
presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would
answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now and if not, I will
take it by force.

 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
LORD for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with
a linen ephod.

 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him
from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the
yearly sacrifice.

 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And
they went unto their own home.

 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the
LORD.

 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.

 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your
evil dealings by all this people.

 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear ye make the
LORD's people to transgress.

 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him but if
a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding
they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD
would slay them.

 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
LORD, and also with men.

 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,
when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?   And did I choose him
out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine
altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give
unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the
children of Israel?   Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at
mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest
thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
offerings of Israel my people?   Wherefore the LORD God of Israel
saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father,
should walk before me for ever but now the LORD saith, Be it far from
me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me
shall be lightly esteemed.

 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm
of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine
house.

 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth
which God shall give Israel and there shall not be an old man in
thine house for ever.

 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,
shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart and all the
increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.

 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two
sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according
to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and I will build him a
sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.

 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine
house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel
of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests'
offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the
word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.

 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;  And
ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark
of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;  That the LORD
called Samuel and he answered, Here am I.

 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.
And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.

 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered,
I called not, my son; lie down again.

 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the
LORD yet revealed unto him.

 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and
went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
perceived that the LORD had called the child.

 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down and it shall be, if
he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant
heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.

 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.

 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
spoken concerning his house when I begin, I will also make an end.

 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and
he restrained them not.

 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
offering for ever.

 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
answered, Here am I.

 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?
I pray thee hide it not from me God do so to thee, and more also, if
thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.

 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
said, It is the LORD let him do what seemeth him good.

 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
his words fall to the ground.

 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
established to be a prophet of the LORD.

 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh for the LORD revealed
himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer and
the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel and
when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines
and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.

 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel
said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the
Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of
Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of
the hand of our enemies.

 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence
the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between
the cherubims and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were
there with the ark of the covenant of God.

 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,
all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.

 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?
And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.

 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into
the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a
thing heretofore.

 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues
in the wilderness.

 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye
be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you quit
yourselves like men, and fight.

 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled
every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter; for
there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were slain.

 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his
head.

 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
watching for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man
came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.

 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth
the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.

 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
that he could not see.

 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and
I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my
son?   And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before
the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the
people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the
ark of God is taken.

 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that
he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his
neck brake, and he died for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had
judged Israel forty years.

 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to
be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was
taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed
herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.

 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not,
neither did she regard it.

 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
from Israel because the ark of God was taken, and because of her
father in law and her husband.

 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel for the ark of
God is taken.

 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon
was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And
they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the
head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the
threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.

 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this
day.

 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the
coasts thereof.

 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark
of the God of Israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore
upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of
Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried
about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about
thither.

 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of
the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction and he
smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods
in their secret parts.

 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,
as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us
and our people.

 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let
it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people for
there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of
God was very heavy there.

 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the
cry of the city went up to heaven.

 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
seven months.

 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we
shall send it to his place.

 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send
it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye
shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not
removed from you.

 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall
return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden
mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines for one
plague was on you all, and on your lords.

 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your
mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of
Israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from
off your gods, and from off your land.

 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among
them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?   Now
therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there
hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their
calves home from them  And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it
upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a
trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
that it may go.

 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil but if not, then we
shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that
happened to us.

 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
cart, and shut up their calves at home  And they laid the ark of
the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the
images of their emerods.

 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to
the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went
after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.

 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
valley and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced
to see it.

 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
stood there, where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of
the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.

 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the
great stone and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and
sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.

 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
returned to Ekron the same day.

 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,
for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;  And the golden
mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines
belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country
villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the
ark of the LORD which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
Joshua, the Bethshemite.

 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into
the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and
threescore and ten men and the people lamented, because the LORD had
smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.

 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this
holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?   And they sent
messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The
Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and
fetch it up to you.

 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.

 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that
the time was long; for it was twenty years and all the house of
Israel lamented after the LORD.

 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange
gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the
LORD, and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of
the Philistines.

 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
served the LORD only.

 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for
you unto the LORD.

 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We
have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel
in Mizpeh.

 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up
against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were
afraid of the Philistines.

 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto
the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the
Philistines.

 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
offering wholly unto the LORD and Samuel cried unto the LORD for
Israel; and the LORD heard him.

 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
drew near to battle against Israel but the LORD thundered with a
great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them;
and they were smitten before Israel.

 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped
us.

 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
coast of Israel and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines
all the days of Samuel.

 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof
did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was
peace between Israel and the Amorites.

 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,
and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there
he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.

 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
judges over Israel.

 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
second, Abiah they were judges in Beersheba.

 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and
came to Samuel unto Ramah,  And said unto him, Behold, thou art
old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us
like all the nations.

 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

 According to all the works which they have done since the day that
I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have
forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

 Now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest
solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall
reign over them.

 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
asked of him a king.

 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
over you He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for
his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his
chariots.

 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his
harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his
chariots.

 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
cooks, and to be bakers.

 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
and give to his officers, and to his servants.

 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

 He will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his
servants.

 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;  That we also may
be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out
before us, and fight our battles.

 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the LORD.

 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make
them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man
unto his city.

 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a
Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
goodly and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier
person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any
of the people.

 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to
Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go
seek the asses.

 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land
of Shalisha, but they found them not then they passed through the
land of Shalim, and there they were not and he passed through the
land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.

 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father
leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of
God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to
pass now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that
we should go.

 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is
not a present to bring to the man of God what have we?   And the
servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the
fourth part of a shekel of silver that will I give to the man of God,
to tell us our way.

 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
spake, Come, and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a
Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)   Then said Saul to his
servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where
the man of God was.

 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
you make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a
sacrifice of the people to day in the high place  As soon as ye
be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up
to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come,
because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be
bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find
him.

 And they went up into the city and when they were come into the
city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high
place.

 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
saying,  To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of
the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my
people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the
Philistines for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is
come unto me.

 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man
whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I
pray thee, where the seer's house is.

 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer go up before
me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow
I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.

 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of
Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?   And
Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the
tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the
tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?   And
Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour,
and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,
which were about thirty persons.

 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!
set it before thee, and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for
thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with
Samuel that day.

 And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

 And they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the
day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that
I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,
he and Samuel, abroad.

 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said
to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but
stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to
be captain over his inheritance?   When thou art departed from me
to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the
border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses
which thou wentest to seek are found and, lo, thy father hath left
the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do
for my son?   Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou
shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another
carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine
 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
which thou shalt receive of their hands.

 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
garrison of the Philistines and it shall come to pass, when thou art
come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets
coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a
pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy  And the
Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with
them, and shalt be turned into another man.

 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do
as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will
come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice
sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry, till I
come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
Samuel, God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass
that day.

 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
prophesied among them.

 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to
another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also
among the prophets?   And one of the same place answered and
said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul
also among the prophets?   And when he had made an end of
prophesying, he came to the high place.

 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went
ye?  And he said, To seek the asses and when we saw that they were no
where, we came to Samuel.

 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
unto you.

 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses
were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he
told him not.

 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of
them that oppressed you  And ye have this day rejected your God,
who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your
tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.
Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and
by your thousands.

 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was
taken and when they sought him, he could not be found.

 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself
among the stuff.

 And they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the
people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and
upward.

 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the
people shouted, and said, God save the king.

 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the
people away, every man to his house.

 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And
they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.

 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
Jabeshgilead and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a
covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I
make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes,
and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel
and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices,
and wept.

 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul
said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the
tidings of the men of Jabesh.

 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,
and his anger was kindled greatly.

 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers,
saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so
shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the
people, and they came out with one consent.

 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were
three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot,
ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men
of Jabesh; and they were glad.

 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.

 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning
watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day and it came
to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them
were not left together.

 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day
for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
and renew the kingdom there.

 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of
peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of
Israel rejoiced greatly.

 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.

 And now, behold, the king walketh before you and I am old and
grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you and I have walked
before you from my childhood unto this day.

 Behold, here I am witness against me before the LORD, and before
his anointed whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or
whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I
received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it
you.

 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his
anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.
And they answered, He is witness.

 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of
Egypt.

 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the
LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to
your fathers.

 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the
LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your
fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought
against them.

 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because
we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth but
now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.

 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every
side, and ye dwelled safe.

 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over
us when the LORD your God was your king.

 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and
not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and
also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your
God  But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD
be against you, as it was against your fathers.

 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
will do before your eyes.

 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your
wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in
asking you a king.

 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
rain that day and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.

 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto
the LORD thy God, that we die not for we have added unto all our sins
this evil, to ask us a king.

 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not ye have done all this
wickedness yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the
LORD with all your heart;  And turn ye not aside for then should
ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are
vain.

 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
sake because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
LORD in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the
right way  Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all
your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you.

 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye
and your king.

 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
Israel,  Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin and the rest of the
people he sent every man to his tent.

 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet
throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the
Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.

 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and
people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they
came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.

 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,
and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.

 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed
him trembling.

 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
had appointed but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were
scattered from him.

 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to
meet him, that he might salute him.

 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not
within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered
themselves together at Michmash;  Therefore said I, The
Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made
supplication unto the LORD I forced myself therefore, and offered a
burnt offering.

 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly thou hast not
kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee for
now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.

 But now thy kingdom shall not continue the LORD hath sought him
a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be
captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the
LORD commanded thee.

 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him,
about six hundred men.

 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present
with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin but the Philistines encamped
in Michmash.

 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to
Ophrah, unto the land of Shual  And another company turned the
way to Bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border
that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel
for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears
 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.

 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and
for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with
Saul and Jonathan but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there
found.

 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
Michmash.

 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over
to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told
not his father.

 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
pomegranate tree which is in Migron and the people that were with him
were about six hundred men;  And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,
Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's
priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that
Jonathan was gone.

 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one
side, and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was
Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be
that the LORD will work for us for there is no restraint to the LORD
to save by many or by few.

 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
heart turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and
we will discover ourselves unto them.

 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up for
the LORD hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign
unto us.

 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.
And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me for the
LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
his armourbearer after him and they fell before Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew after him.

 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,
which a yoke of oxen might plow.

 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all
the people the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and
the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling.

 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one
another.

 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold,
Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased
and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
themselves, and they came to the battle and, behold, every man's
sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.

 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round
about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with
Saul and Jonathan.

 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also
followed hard after them in the battle.

 So the LORD saved Israel that day and the battle passed over
unto Bethaven.

 And the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had
adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food
until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the
people tasted any food.

 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
upon the ground.

 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared
the oath.

 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his
hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth;
and his eyes were enlightened.

 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth
any food this day. And the people were faint.

 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land see, I
pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a
little of this honey.

 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been
now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?   And they
smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon and the
people were very faint.

 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them
with the blood.

 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day.

 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating
with the blood.

And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and
slew them there.

 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD the same was the first
altar that he built unto the LORD.

 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of
them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said
the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he
answered him not that day.

 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people
and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among
all the people that answered him.

 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto
Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect
lot.

And Saul and Jonathan were taken but the people escaped.

 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
Jonathan was taken.

 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the
end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.

 And Saul answered, God do so and more also for thou shalt
surely die, Jonathan.

 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid as the LORD
liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for
he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan,
that he died not.

 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines and the
Philistines went to their own place.

 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of
Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against
the Philistines and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.

 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua
and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal  And the
name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz and the name
of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
the son of Abiel.

 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
Saul and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took
him unto him.

 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be
king over his people, over Israel now therefore hearken thou unto the
voice of the words of the LORD.

 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from
Egypt.

 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and sheep, camel and ass.

 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them for ye shewed
kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of
Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to
Shur, that is over against Egypt.

 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was
good, and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was
vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,  It
repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he is turned back
from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it
grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.

 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a
place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

 And Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
of the LORD I have performed the commandment of the LORD.

 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?   And Saul
said, They have brought them from the Amalekites for the people
spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the
LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the
LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast
thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed
thee king over Israel?   And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and
said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight
against them until they be consumed.

 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought
Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto
the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold,
to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the
LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned for I have
transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words because I
feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
me, that I may worship the LORD.

 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee for thou
hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee
from being king over Israel.

 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,
that is better than thou.

 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he
is not a man, that he should repent.

 Then he said, I have sinned yet honour me now, I pray thee,
before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with
me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.

 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely
the bitterness of death is past.

 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in
pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
Gibeah of Saul.

 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and the LORD repented that he
had made Saul king over Israel.

 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn
with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I
have provided me a king among his sons.

 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to
sacrifice to the LORD.

 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou
shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.

 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest
thou peaceably?   And he said, Peaceably I am come to sacrifice
unto the LORD sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.
And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
sacrifice.

 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on
the height of his stature; because I have refused him for the LORD
seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but
the LORD looketh on the heart.

 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And
he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
LORD chosen this.

 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the
sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him for we will not
sit down till he come hither.

 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of
a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,
Arise, anoint him for this is he.

 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
of his brethren and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that
day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
spirit from the LORD troubled him.

 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
from God troubleth thee.

 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to
seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come
to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall
play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.

 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
play well, and bring him to me.

 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen
a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a
mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a
comely person, and the LORD is with him.

 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
David thy son, which is with the sheep.

 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

 And David came to Saul, and stood before him and he loved him
greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand so Saul was
refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and
pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the
Philistines.

 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley
between them.

 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand
shekels of brass.

 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
between his shoulders.

 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a
shield went before him.

 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto
them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a
Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let
him come down to me.

 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be
your servants but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall
ye be our servants, and serve us.

 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
give me a man, that we may fight together.

 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons and the man went among
men for an old man in the days of Saul.

 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were
Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third
Shammah.

 And David was the youngest and the three eldest followed Saul.

 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep
at Bethlehem.

 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
himself forty days.

 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an
ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp
of thy brethren;  And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of
their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.

 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came
to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted
for the battle.

 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
against army.

 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.

 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
Philistines, and spake according to the same words and David heard
them.

 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
and were sore afraid.

 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up and it shall be, that the
man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and
will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in
Israel.

 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall
be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the
reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that
he should defy the armies of the living God?   And the people
answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man
that killeth him.

 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest
thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for
thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.

 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
manner and the people answered him again after the former manner.

 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
them before Saul and he sent for him.

 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him;
thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth, and he a man
of war from his youth.

 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock
 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of
his mouth and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard,
and smote him, and slew him.

 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this
uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God.

 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of
the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the
LORD be with thee.

 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go
with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.

 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he
had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand and he drew near
to the Philistine.

 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man
that bare the shield went before him.

 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
disdained him for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
countenance.

 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest
to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
sword, and with a spear, and with a shield but I come to thee in the
name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou
hast defied.

 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the
air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know
that there is a God in Israel.

 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
sword and spear for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you
into our hands.

 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army
to meet the Philistine.

 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone
sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword
in the hand of David.

 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut
off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion
was dead, they fled.

 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the
gates of Ekron.

And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,
even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?
And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the
Philistine in his hand.

 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to
his father's house.

 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as
his own soul.

 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and
gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow,
and to his girdle.

 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
himself wisely and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was
accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of
Saul's servants.

 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities
of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with
joy, and with instruments of musick.

 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have
ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom?
 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house and David
played with his hand, as at other times and there was a javelin in
Saul's hand.

 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even
to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.

 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and
was departed from Saul.

 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.

 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
was with him.

 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he
was afraid of him.

 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
came in before them.

 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will
I give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's
battles.

For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the
Philistines be upon him.

 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the
Meholathite to wife.

 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David and they told Saul, and
the thing pleased him.

 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in
the one of the twain.

 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his
servants love thee now therefore be the king's son in law.

 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And
David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law,
seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?   And the
servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.

 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not
any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged
of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand
of the Philistines.

 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
well to be the king's son in law and the days were not expired.

 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and
they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's
son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.

 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
David's enemy continually.

 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth and it came to
pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely
than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that
they should kill David.

 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David and Jonathan
told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee now
therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and
abide in a secret place, and hide thyself  And I will go out and
stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune
with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.

 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said
unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;
because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have
been to thee-ward very good  For he did put his life in his hand,
and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for
all Israel thou sawest it, and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt
thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?  
And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan and Saul sware, As the
LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
things.

And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in
times past.

 And there was war again and David went out, and fought with the
Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from
him.

 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his
house with his javelin in his hand and David played with his hand.

 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
javelin but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the
javelin into the wall and David fled, and escaped that night.

 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and
to slay him in the morning and Michal David's wife told him, saying,
If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.

 So Michal let David down through a window and he went, and
fled, and escaped.

 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.

 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
sick.

 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image
in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.

 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He
said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?   So David fled,
and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul
had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.

 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
Ramah.

 And Saul sent messengers to take David and when they saw the
company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed
over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they
also prophesied.

 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time,
and they prophesied also.

 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
Sechu and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one
said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God
was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to
Naioth in Ramah.

 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that
night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?   And
David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan,
What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy
father, that he seeketh my life?   And he said unto him, God
forbid; thou shalt not die behold, my father will do nothing either
great or small, but that he will shew it me and why should my father
hide this thing from me? it is not so.

 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan
know this, lest he be grieved but truly as the LORD liveth, and as
thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.

 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
will even do it for thee.

 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,
and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go,
that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.

 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city for there is a
yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace but if
he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.

 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee
notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why
shouldest thou bring me to thy father?   And Jonathan said, Far be
it from thee for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my
father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?   Then
said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father
answer thee roughly?   And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and
let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the
field.

 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have
sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and,
behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,
and shew it thee;  The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan but
if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and
send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace and the LORD be with
thee, as he hath been with my father.

 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of
the LORD, that I die not  But also thou shalt not cut off thy
kindness from my house for ever no, not when the LORD hath cut off
the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.

 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let
the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him
for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon and thou
shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the
business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.

 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
shot at a mark.

 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side
of thee, take them; then come thou for there is peace to thee, and no
hurt; as the LORD liveth.

 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
beyond thee; go thy way for the LORD hath sent thee away.

 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

 So David hid himself in the field and when the new moon was
come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
seat by the wall and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side,
and David's place was empty.

 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day for he thought,
Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
the month, that David's place was empty and Saul said unto Jonathan
his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither
yesterday, nor to day?   And Jonathan answered Saul, David
earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem  And he said, Let
me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and
my brother, he hath commanded me to be there and now, if I have found
favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my
brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.

 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that
thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the
confusion of thy mother's nakedness?   For as long as the son of
Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy
kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely
die.

 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?   And Saul cast a
javelin at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was
determined of his father to slay David.

 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for David,
because his father had done him shame.

 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the
arrow beyond thee?   And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make
speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and
came to his master.

 But the lad knew not any thing only Jonathan and David knew the
matter.

 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,
Go, carry them to the city.

 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
himself three times and they kissed one another, and wept one with
another, until David exceeded.

 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between
me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose
and departed and Jonathan went into the city.

 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest and Ahimelech was
afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone,
and no man with thee?   And David said unto Ahimelech the priest,
The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no
man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I
have commanded thee and I have appointed my servants to such and such
a place.

 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have
kept themselves at least from women.

 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out,
and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a
manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

 So the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread
there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put
hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine
hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my
weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.

 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a
cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that, take it for there is
no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give
it me.

 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
Achish the king of Gath.

 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the
king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances,
saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid
of Achish the king of Gath.

 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let
his spittle fall down upon his beard.

 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad
wherefore then have ye brought him to me?   Have I need of mad
men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my
presence? shall this fellow come into my house?   David therefore
departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam and when his
brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither
to him.

 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto
him; and he became a captain over them and there were with him about
four hundred men.

 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab and he said unto the
king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,
and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

 And he brought them before the king of Moab and they dwelt with
him all the while that David was in the hold.

 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and
came into the forest of Hareth.

 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were
with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his
spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) 
Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye
Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and
vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of
hundreds;  That all of you have conspired against me, and there is
none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto
me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait,
as at this day?   Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set
over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and
gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob and
they came all of them to the king.

 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
Here I am, my lord.

 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword,
and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to
lie in wait, as at this day?   Then Ahimelech answered the king,
and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David,
which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is
honourable in thine house?   Did I then begin to enquire of God
for him? be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his
servant, nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew
nothing of all this, less or more.

 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
all thy father's house.

 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
and slay the priests of the LORD because their hand also is with
David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.
But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall
upon the priests of the LORD.

 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.
And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on
that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.

 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and
asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
priests.

 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul I have occasioned
the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

 Abide thou with me, fear not for he that seeketh my life
seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite
the Philistines, and save Keilah.

 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
Judah how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of
the Philistines?   Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And
the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a
great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to
David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.

 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by
entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;
and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the
city for my sake.

 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech
thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.

 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.

 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it
was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go
forth.

 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every
day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life and David
was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood,
and strengthened his hand in God.

 And he said unto him, Fear not for the hand of Saul my father
shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall
be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

 And they two made a covenant before the LORD and David abode in
the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of
Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?   Now therefore, O
king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down;
and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.

 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion
on me.

 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
his haunt is, and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he
dealeth very subtilly.

 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty,
and I will go with you and it shall come to pass, if he be in the
land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of
Judah.

 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul but David and his
men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of
Jeshimon.

 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of
Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the
wilderness of Maon.

 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
men on that side of the mountain and David made haste to get away for
fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round
about to take them.

 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
against the Philistines therefore they called that place
Selahammahlekoth.

 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
Engedi.

 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the
wilderness of Engedi.

 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and
went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.

 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
Saul went in to cover his feet and David and his men remained in the
sides of the cave.

 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the
LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine
hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then
David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.

 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this
thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand
against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.

 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went
on his way.

 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,
David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.

 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?   Behold, this day thine
eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine
hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared
thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for
he is the LORD's anointed.

 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
hand for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee
not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in
mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my
soul to take it.

 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from
the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son
David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I for thou
hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
me forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou
killedst me not.

 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me
this day.

 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my
father's house.

 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his
men gat them up unto the hold.

 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,
and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David
arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a
thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful
countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he
was of the house of Caleb.

 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.

 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young
men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name
 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be
both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that
thou hast.

 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds
which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing
unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.

 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give,
I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to
thy son David.

 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to
all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and
who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break
away every man from his master.

 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not
whence they be?   So David's young men turned their way, and went
again, and came and told him all those sayings.

 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And
they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his
sword and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two
hundred abode by the stuff.

 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
master; and he railed on them.

 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them,
when we were in the fields  They were a wall unto us both by
night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.

 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
determined against our master, and against all his household for he
is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.

 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of
parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred
cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come
after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against
her; and she met them.

 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that
pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good.

 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of
all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against
the wall.

 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,
and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
this iniquity be and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine
audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
Nabal for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is
with him but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom
thou didst send.

 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed
blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine
enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.

 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the
LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee
all thy days.

 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy
God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out
of the middle of a sling.

 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee,
and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;  That this shall
be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that
thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself
but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember
thine handmaid.

 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
which sent thee this day to meet me  And blessed be thy advice,
and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed
blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.

 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to
meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning
light any that pisseth against the wall.

 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within
him, for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing, less or
more, until the morning light.

 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died
within him, and he became as a stone.

 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
Nabal, that he died.

 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of
Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil for the LORD hath returned
the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed
with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.

 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to
him to wife.

 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the
servants of my lord.

 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers
of David, and became his wife.

 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
them his wives.

 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti
the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?  
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three
thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the
wilderness of Ziph.

 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw
that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come
in very deed.

 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched
and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,
the captain of his host and Saul lay in the trench, and the people
pitched round about him.

 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down
with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with
thee.

 So David and Abishai came to the people by night and, behold,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster but Abner and the people lay round about him.

 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into
thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with
the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the
second time.

 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not for who can stretch
forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?  
David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him;
or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and
perish.

 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
the LORD's anointed but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is
at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,
neither awaked for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from
the LORD was fallen upon them.

 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of
an hill afar off; a great space being between them  And David
cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest
thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that
criest to the king?   And David said to Abner, Art not thou a
valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast
thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in
to destroy the king thy lord.

 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's
anointed.

And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was
at his bolster.

 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
servant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  
Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his
servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept
an offering but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before
the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the
inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.

 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
face of the LORD for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea,
as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

 Then said Saul, I have sinned return, my son David for I will
no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this
day behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
one of the young men come over and fetch it.

 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I
would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.

 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him
deliver me out of all tribulation.

 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David thou
shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David
went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
hand of Saul there is nothing better for me than that I should
speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall
despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel so shall I
escape out of his hand.

 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath and he sought
no more again for him.

 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may
dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with
thee?   Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day wherefore Ziklag
pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines
was a full year and four months.

 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
the Gezrites, and the Amalekites for those nations were of old the
inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of
Egypt.

 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,
and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels,
and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.

 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and
so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
Philistines.

 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for
ever.

 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered
their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish
said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me
to battle, thou and thy men.

 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant
can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of
mine head for ever.

 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried
him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that
had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.

 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
pitched in Shunem and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they
pitched in Gilboa.

 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and
his heart greatly trembled.

 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his
servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar
spirit at Endor.

 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night and
he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring
me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath
done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the
wizards, out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my
life, to cause me to die?   And Saul sware to her by the LORD,
saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee
for this thing.

 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
said, Bring me up Samuel.

 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice and
the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou
art Saul.

 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid for what sawest thou?
And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.

 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived
that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and
bowed himself.

 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no
more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams therefore I have called
thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.

 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?   And the
LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me for the LORD hath rent the
kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to
David  Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done
this thing unto thee this day.

 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
hand of the Philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with
me the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of
the Philistines.

 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
afraid, because of the words of Samuel and there was no strength in
him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.

 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I
have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which
thou spakest unto me.

 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of
thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat,
that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their
voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened
bread thereof  And she brought it before Saul, and before his
servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that
night.

 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek
and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.

 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
thousands but David and his men passed on in the rereward with
Achish.

 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews
here?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not
this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been
with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him
since he fell unto me unto this day?   And the princes of the
Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines
said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his
place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us
to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith
should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the
heads of these men?   Is not this David, of whom they sang one to
another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten
thousands?   Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,
as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for I have not
found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day
nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
the lords of the Philistines.

 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast
thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this
day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good
in my sight, as an angel of God notwithstanding the princes of the
Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the
morning, and have light, depart.

 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up
to Jezreel.

 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag
on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and
Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;  And had
taken the women captives, that were therein they slew not any, either
great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.

 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned
with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were
taken captives.

 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his
sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the LORD
his God.

 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the
ephod to David.

 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this
troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue for thou
shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.

 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

 But David pursued, he and four hundred men for two hundred
abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the
brook Besor.

 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink
water;  And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two
clusters of raisins and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
him for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and
three nights.

 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;
and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.

 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon
the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and
we burned Ziklag with fire.

 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor
deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to
this company.

 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because
of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the
Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
the next day and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred
young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away
and David rescued his two wives.

 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had
taken to them David recovered all.

 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that
they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the
brook Besor and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people
that were with him and when David came near to the people, he saluted
them.

 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every
man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and
depart.

 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the
company that came against us into our hand.

 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by
the stuff they shall part alike.

 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you
of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;  To them which were in
Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were
in Jattir,  And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which
were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,  And to
them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the
Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,
 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,  And to them which
were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men
were wont to haunt.

 Now the Philistines fought against Israel and the men of Israel
fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,
Saul's sons.

 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;
and he was sore wounded of the archers.

 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me
through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore
afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all
his men, that same day together.

 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men
of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the
cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in
mount Gilboa.

 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent
into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the
house of their idols, and among the people.

 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth and they
fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
Philistines had done to Saul;  All the valiant men arose, and
went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons
from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
Jabesh, and fasted seven days.




The Second Book of Samuel

Otherwise Called

The Second Book of the Kings


 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two
days in Ziklag;  It came even to pass on the third day, that,
behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent,
and earth upon his head and so it was, when he came to David, that he
fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell
me.

And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of
the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are
dead also.

 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?   And the young man that
told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul
leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed
hard after him.

 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And
I answered, Here am I.

 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
Amalekite.

 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me
for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
could not live after that he was fallen and I took the crown that was
upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought
them hither unto my lord.

 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
all the men that were with him  And they mourned, and wept, and
fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the
people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were
fallen by the sword.

 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?
And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?   And David
called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And
he smote him that he died.

 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's
anointed.

 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
Jonathan his son  (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah
the use of the bow behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places how are the
mighty fallen!   Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the
streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be
rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the
mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not
been anointed with oil.

 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow
of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in
their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles, they
were stronger than lions.

 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your
apparel.

 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
thou wast slain in thine high places.

 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan very pleasant hast
thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
women.

 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  
And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD,
saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD
said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he
said, Unto Hebron.

 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with
his household and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over
the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of
Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said
unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this
kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.

 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you and I also will
requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant
for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have
anointed me king over them.

 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth
the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;  And made him
king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over
Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign
over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed
David.

 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
Judah was seven years and six months.

 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
and met together by the pool of Gibeon and they sat down, the one on
the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the
servants of David.

 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together wherefore that
place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
and Asahel and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the
right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
answered, I am.

 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his
armour.

But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.

 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
me wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I
hold up my face to Joab thy brother?   Howbeit he refused to turn
aside wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him
under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell
down there, and died in the same place and it came to pass, that as
many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner and the sun went down
when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by
the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after
Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for
ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from
following their brethren?   And Joab said, As God liveth, unless
thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up
every one from following his brother.

 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to
Mahanaim.

 And Joab returned from following Abner and when he had gathered
all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men
and Asahel.

 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's
men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night,
and they came to Hebron at break of day.

 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
David but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker.

 And unto David were sons born in Hebron and his firstborn was
Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;  And his second, Chileab, of
Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the
son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;  And the
fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son
of Abital;  And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These
were born to David in Hebron.

 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul
and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house
of Saul.

 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of
Aiah and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto
my father's concubine?   Then was Abner very wroth for the words of
Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew
kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of
David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this
woman?   So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD
hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;  To translate the
kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over
Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
him.

 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose
is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my
hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee but one thing
I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou
first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred
foreskins of the Philistines.

 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
Phaltiel the son of Laish.

 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
Bahurim.

Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
sought for David in times past to be king over you  Now then do
it for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my
servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the
Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin and Abner went also
to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to
Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.

 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather
all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with
thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.
And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
troop, and brought in a great spoil with them but Abner was not with
David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent
him away, and he is gone in peace.

 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away,
and he is quite gone?   Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he
came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and
to know all that thou doest.

 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after
Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah but David knew
it not.

 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth
rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of
Ner  Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an
issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth
on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,
Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before
Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

 And they buried Abner in Hebron and the king lifted up his
voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
dieth?   Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters
as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
people wept again over him.

 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it
was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I
taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them as
whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was
not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?   And I am this
day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be
too hard for me the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to
his wickedness.

 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands the name
of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of
Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also
was reckoned to Benjamin.

 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
until this day.)   And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was
lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul
and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled and
it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became
lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay
on a bed at noon.

 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they
would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib and
Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and
took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.

 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and
said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine
enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the
king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who
hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  When one told me,
saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I
took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would
have given him a reward for his tidings  How much more, when
wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his
bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and
take you away from the earth?   And David commanded his young men,
and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged
them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
leddest out and broughtest in Israel and the LORD said to thee, Thou
shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.

 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD and they
anointed David king over Israel.

 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
forty years.

 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months and in
Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
inhabitants of the land which spake unto David, saying, Except thou
take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither
thinking, David cannot come in hither.

 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion the same is the
city of David.

 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated
of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said,
The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.

 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And
David built round about from Millo and inward.

 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was
with him.

 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
and carpenters, and masons and they built David an house.

 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's
sake.

 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
after he was come from Hebron and there were yet sons and daughters
born to David.

 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,  Ibhar
also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  And Elishama, and
Eliada, and Eliphalet.

 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David
heard of it, and went down to the hold.

 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
Rephaim.

 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said
unto David, Go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
thine hand.

 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the
breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place
Baalperazim.

 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
them.

 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in
the valley of Rephaim.

 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go
up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against
the mulberry trees.

 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then
shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the
Philistines.

 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
thirty thousand.

 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him
from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose
name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between
the cherubims.

 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of
the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons
of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God and Ahio went before the ark.

 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on
all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on
psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote
him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.

 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
Uzzah and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the
ark of the LORD come to me?   So David would not remove the ark of
the LORD unto him into the city of David but David carried it aside
into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
Gittite three months and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his
household.

 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the
ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house
of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.

 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had
gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
was girded with a linen ephod.

 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping
and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.

 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,
in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it and
David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of
hosts.

 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread,
and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people
departed every one to his house.

 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was
the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of
the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly
uncovereth himself!   And David said unto Michal, It was before
the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,
to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel
therefore will I play before the LORD.

 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine
own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them
shall I be had in honour.

 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day
of her death.

 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD
had given him rest round about from all his enemies;  That the king
said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar,
but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;
for the LORD is with thee.

 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
unto Nathan, saying,  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the
LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?   Whereas I
have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the
children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in
a tent and in a tabernacle.

 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I
commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an
house of cedar?   Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant
David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,
from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel 
And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all
thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like
unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.

 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no
more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,
as beforetime,  And as since the time that I commanded judges to
be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of
thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever.

 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
of the children of men  But my mercy shall not depart away from
him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.

 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee thy throne shall be established for ever.

 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
so did Nathan speak unto David.

 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me
hitherto?   And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord
GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great
while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?   And
what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy
servant.

 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.

 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God for there is none like
thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we
have heard with our ears.

 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make
him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land,
before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the
nations and their gods?   For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy
people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou, LORD, art
become their God.

 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do
as thou hast said.

 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts
is the God over Israel and let the house of thy servant David be
established before thee.

 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
servant, saying, I will build thee an house therefore hath thy
servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant  Therefore
now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may
continue for ever before thee for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it
and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for
ever.

 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,
and subdued them and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the
Philistines.

 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death,
and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became
David's servants, and brought gifts.

 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen and David houghed all the
chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.

 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus and the Syrians
became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved
David whithersoever he went.

 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
took exceeding much brass.

 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host
of Hadadezer,  Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to
salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer,
and smitten him for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought
with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass
 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver
and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; 
Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the
Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of
Rehob, king of Zobah.

 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD
preserved David whithersoever he went.

 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
and justice unto all his people.

 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud was recorder;  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the
scribe;  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the
Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?   And there
was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they
had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And
he said, Thy servant is he.

 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that
I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king,
Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.

 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the
king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in
Lodebar.

 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,
the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was
come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David
said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!   And
David said unto him, Fear not for I will surely shew thee kindness
for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of
Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.

 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?   Then the king called
to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy
master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.

 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's
son may have food to eat but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat
bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty
servants.

 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the
king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for
Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the
king's sons.

 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all
that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem for he did eat continually at
the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of
Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to
comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants
unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even
to their buttocks, and sent them away.

 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the
men were greatly ashamed and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until
your beards be grown, and then return.

 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,
the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the
Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a
thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.

 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
mighty men.

 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
at the entering in of the gate and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob,
and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.

 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before
and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in
array against the Syrians  And the rest of the people he
delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them
in array against the children of Ammon.

 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
shalt help me but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,
then I will come and help thee.

 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and
for the cities of our God and the LORD do that which seemeth him
good.

 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the
battle against the Syrians and they fled before him.

 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab
returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.

 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
they gathered themselves together.

 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond
the river and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host
of Hadarezer went before them.

 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves
in array against David, and fought with him.

 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen,
and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.

 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that
they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and
served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any
more.

 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when
kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with
him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and
besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off
his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the
roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful
to look upon.

 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not
this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness
and she returned unto her house.

 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am
with child.

 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
Joab sent Uriah to David.

 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab
did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a
mess of meat from the king.

 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?
why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?   And Uriah
said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and
my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open
fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to
lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not
do this thing.

 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the
morrow.

 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;
and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with
the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to
Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may
be smitten, and die.

 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.

 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab and
there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the
Hittite died also.

 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of
telling the matters of the war unto the king,  And if so be that
the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye
so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would
shoot from the wall?   Who smote Abimelech the son of
Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him
from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then
say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
had sent him for.

 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them
even unto the entering of the gate.

 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite
is dead also.

 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one
as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city, and
overthrow it and encourage thou him.

 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
dead, she mourned for her husband.

 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing
that David had done displeased the LORD.

 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the
other poor.

 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds  But the
poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought
and nourished up and it grew up together with him, and with his
children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and
lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed
it for the man that was come to him.

 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing
shall surely die  And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because
he did this thing, and because he had no pity.

 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD
God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee
out of the hand of Saul;  And I gave thee thy master's house, and
thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel
and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
given unto thee such and such things.

 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do
evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the
sword of the children of Ammon.

 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the
Hittite to be thy wife.

 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,
and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in
the sight of this sun.

 For thou didst it secretly but I will do this thing before all
Israel, and before the sun.

 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou
shalt not die.

 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto
thee shall surely die.

 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him
up from the earth but he would not, neither did he eat bread with
them.

 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And
the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for
they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,
and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself,
if we tell him that the child is dead?   But when David saw that
his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead
therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they
said, He is dead.

 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD,
and worshipped then he came to his own house; and when he required,
they set bread before him, and he did eat.

 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;
but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept
for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the
child may live?   But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?
can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return
to me.

 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
and lay with her and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon
and the LORD loved him.

 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his
name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
took the royal city.

 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
against the city, and take it lest I take the city, and it be called
after my name.

 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
and fought against it, and took it.

 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set
on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great
abundance.

 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and
made them pass through the brick-kiln and thus did he unto all the
cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned
unto Jerusalem.

 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had
a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved
her.

 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything
to her.

 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
Shimeah David's brother and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I
love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I
pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the
meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick and when the king was
come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my
sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat
at her hand.

 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.
And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and
did bake the cakes.

 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they
went out every man from him.

 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that
I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made,
and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
such thing ought to be done in Israel do not thou this folly.

 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray
thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but, being stronger
than she, forced her, and lay with her.

 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And
Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

 And she said unto him, There is no cause this evil in sending
me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he
would not hearken unto her.

 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such
robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his
servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on
crying.

 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister he is thy brother;
regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother
Absalom's house.

 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
wroth.

 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad
for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim and Absalom
invited all the king's sons.

 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant
hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go
with thy servant.

 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him howbeit he
would not go, but blessed him.

 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go
with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
sons go with him.

 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite
Amnon; then kill him, fear not have not I commanded you? be
courageous, and be valiant.

 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
commanded.

Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his
mule, and fled.

 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and
there is not one of them left.

 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men
the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead for by the appointment of
Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his
sister Tamar.

 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead for Amnon only is
dead.

 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the
way of the hill side behind him.

 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come as
thy servant said, so it is.

 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and
wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom for
he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was
toward Absalom.

 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on
now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a
woman that had a long time mourned for the dead  And come to the
king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her
mouth.

 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her
face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I
am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the
other, and slew him.

 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill
him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the
heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall
not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.

 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will
give charge concerning thee.

 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
iniquity be on me, and on my father's house and the king and his
throne be guiltless.

 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy
any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one
word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as
one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his
banished.

 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any
person yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled
from him.

 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord
the king, it is because the people have made me afraid and thy
handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king
will perform the request of his handmaid.

 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the
inheritance of God.

 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now
be comfortable for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to
discern good and bad therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.

 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said,
Let my lord the king now speak.

 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord
the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought
that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant Joab, he bade me,
and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid  To
fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing
and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to
know all things that are in the earth.

 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing
go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
thanked the king and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I
have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath
fulfilled the request of his servant.

 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
Jerusalem.

 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the
king's face.

 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
Absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of
his head there was no blemish in him.

 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he
polled it) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels
after the king's weight.

 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
whose name was Tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance.

 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
king's face.

 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time,
he would not come.

 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's
servants set the field on fire.

 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?   And
Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,
that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from
Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still now
therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in
me, let him kill me.

 So Joab came to the king, and told him and when he had called
for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
ground before the king and the king kissed Absalom.

 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate
and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the
king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what
city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of
Israel.

 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;
but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I
would do him justice!   And it was so, that when any man came nigh
to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and
kissed him.

 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
king for judgment so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto
the LORD, in Hebron.

 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I
will serve the LORD.

 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
Hebron.

 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall
say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any
thing.

 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased
continually with Absalom.

 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
men of Israel are after Absalom.

 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from
Absalom make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring
evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants
are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.

 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
tarried in a place that was far off.

 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred
men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king for thou
art a stranger, and also an exile.

 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and
take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee.

 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king
shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant
be.

 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with
him.

 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
passed over the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and
all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
the ark of the covenant of God and they set down the ark of God; and
Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the
city.

 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
city if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me
again, and shew me both it, and his habitation  But if he thus
say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him.

 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy
son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
come word from you to certify me.

 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
Jerusalem and they tarried there.

 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he
went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot and all the
people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up,
weeping as they went up.

 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of
Ahithophel into foolishness.

 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the
mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to
meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head  Unto whom
David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden
unto me  But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I
will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt
hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar
the priests.

 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send
unto me every thing that ye can hear.

 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
into Jerusalem.

 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses
saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred
bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of
wine.

 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread
and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as
be faint in the wilderness may drink.

 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said
unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem for he said, To day
shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.

 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained
unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may
find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son
of Gera he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right
hand and on his left.

 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
bloody man, and thou man of Belial  The LORD hath returned upon
thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast
reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
Absalom thy son and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because
thou art a bloody man.

 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and
take off his head.

 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse
David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?   And
David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which
came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life how much more now may this
Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath
bidden him.

 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw
stones at him, and cast dust.

 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,
and refreshed themselves there.

 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the
king, God save the king.

 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?
why wentest thou not with thy friend?   And Hushai said unto
Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of
Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.

 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so
will I be in thy presence.

 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we
shall do.

 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall
hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all
that are with thee be strong.

 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all
Israel.

 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God so was all
the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this
night  And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak
handed, and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him
shall flee; and I will smite the king only  And I will bring back
all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all
returned so all the people shall be in peace.

 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
Israel.

 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
hear likewise what he saith.

 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after
his saying? if not; speak thou.

 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
given is not good at this time.

 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they
be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of
her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war, and will not
lodge with the people.

 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place and it
will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that
whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people
that follow Absalom.

 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
lion, shall utterly melt for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a
mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.

 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.

 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,
and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of
him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so
much as one.

 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until
there be not one small stone found there.

 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the
LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the
intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and
thus and thus have I counselled.

 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over;
lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.

 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them; and
they went and told king David.

 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom but they went
both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which
had a well in his court; whither they went down.

 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth,
and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they
said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,
They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and
could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up
out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,
Arise, and pass quickly over the water for thus hath Ahithophel
counselled against you.

 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
they passed over Jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of
them that was not gone over Jordan.

 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his
city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died,
and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
and all the men of Israel with him.

 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab
which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that
went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's
mother.

 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the
son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and
parched pulse,  And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of
kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat for
they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
wilderness.

 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you
myself also.

 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth for if we flee
away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they
care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now
it is better that thou succour us out of the city.

 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And
the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by
hundreds and by thousands.

 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the
people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning
Absalom.

 So the people went out into the field against Israel and the
battle was in the wood of Ephraim;  Where the people of Israel
were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great
slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.

 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword
devoured.

 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his
head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven
and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.

 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
Absalom hanged in an oak.

 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and
I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand
against the king's son for in our hearing the king charged thee and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man
Absalom.

 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life
for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest
have set thyself against me.

 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
smote Absalom, and slew him.

 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
after Israel for Joab held back the people.

 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all Israel
fled every one to his tent.

 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself
a pillar, which is in the king's dale for he said, I have no son to
keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own
name and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear
no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said,
Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings
ready?   But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto
him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

 And David sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to
the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and behold a man running alone.

 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If
he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and
drew near.

 And the watchman saw another man running and the watchman
called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.
And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He
is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he
fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said,
Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that
lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw
a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
turned aside, and stood still.

 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
king for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up
against thee.

 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise
against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.

 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
gate, and wept and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my
son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
my son!   And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and
mourneth for Absalom.

 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for
his son.

 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!   And Joab
came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day
the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and
the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy
wives, and the lives of thy concubines;  In that thou lovest thine
enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that
thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day I perceive,
that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had
pleased thee well.

 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
servants for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will
not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee
than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.

 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all
the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the
people came before the king for Israel had fled every man to his
tent.

 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and
he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled
out of the land for Absalom.

 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?  
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring
the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to
the king, even to his house.

 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then
are ye the last to bring back the king?   And say ye to Amasa,
Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more
also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the
room of Joab.

 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return
thou, and all thy servants.

 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty
servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.

 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera
fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;  And said
unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do
thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my
lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to
his heart.

 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned therefore, behold,
I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king.

 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
anointed?   And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons
of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know
that I am this day king over Israel?   Therefore the king said
unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.

 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and
had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his
clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in
peace.

 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
Mephibosheth?   And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant
deceived me for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may
ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my
lord the king is as an angel of God do therefore what is good in
thine eyes.

 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at
thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto
the king?   And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any
more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own
house.

 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old and
he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for
he was a very great man.

 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I
will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that
I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?   I am this day
fourscore years old and can I discern between good and evil? can thy
servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the
voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy
servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?   Thy servant will
go a little way over Jordan with the king and why should the king
recompense it me with such a reward?   Let thy servant, I pray
thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried
by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant
Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what
shall seem good unto thee.

 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will
do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou
shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto
his own place.

 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him
and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the
people of Israel.

 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee
away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's
men with him, over Jordan?   And all the men of Judah answered
the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us wherefore
then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's
cost? or hath he given us any gift?   And the men of Israel
answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king,
and we have also more right in David than ye why then did ye despise
us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?
And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
men of Israel.

 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite and he blew a trumpet, and
said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son
of Jesse every man to his tents, O Israel.

 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
Sheba the son of Bichri but the men of Judah clave unto their king,
from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the
ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put
them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were
shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.

 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
three days, and be thou here present.

 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah but he tarried longer
than the set time which he had appointed him.

 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do
us more harm than did Absalom take thou thy lord's servants, and
pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.

 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and
the Pelethites, and all the mighty men and they went out of
Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went
before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto
him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the
sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.

 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab
took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand so
he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to
the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai
his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.

 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out
of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw
that every one that came by him stood still.

 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
Bethmaachah, and all the Berites and they were gathered together, and
went also after him.

 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they
cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench and all
the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
Joab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the
words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel and so they ended the
matter.

 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel thou
seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel why wilt thou
swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?   And Joab answered and
said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or
destroy.

 The matter is not so but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son
of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even
against David deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And
the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee
over the wall.

 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they
cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.
And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to
his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.

 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites  And
Adoram was over the tribute and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was
recorder  And Sheva was scribe and Zadok and Abiathar were the
priests  And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It
is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.

 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of
the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them and Saul
sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
you?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the
inheritance of the LORD?   And the Gibeonites said unto him, We
will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us
shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,
that will I do for you.

 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any
of the coasts of Israel,  Let seven men of his sons be delivered
unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,
whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David
and Jonathan the son of Saul.

 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of
Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of
Barzillai the Meholathite  And he delivered them into the hands
of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD
and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.

 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the
air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
concubine of Saul, had done.

 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them
from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them,
when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa  And he brought up
from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and
they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.

 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father and
they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was
intreated for the land.

 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
Philistines and David waxed faint.

 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he
being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.

 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,
saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench
not the light of Israel.

 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
with the Philistines at Gob then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,
which was of the sons of the giant.

 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's
beam.

 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six
toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.

 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
brother of David slew him.

 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand
of David, and by the hand of his servants.

 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day
that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,
and out of the hand of Saul  And he said, The LORD is my rock,
and my fortress, and my deliverer;  The God of my rock; in him
will I trust he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high
tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.

 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised so shall I
be saved from mine enemies.

 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid;  The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the
snares of death prevented me;  In my distress I called upon the
LORD, and cried to my God and he did hear my voice out of his temple,
and my cry did enter into his ears.

 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
moved and shook, because he was wroth.

 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured coals were kindled by it.

 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under
his feet.

 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly and he was seen upon the
wings of the wind.

 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and
thick clouds of the skies.

 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
voice.

 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
discomfited them.

 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of
the breath of his nostrils.

 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
me for they were too strong for me.

 They prevented me in the day of my calamity but the LORD was my
stay.

 He brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me,
because he delighted in me.

 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness according to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.

 For all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes, I
did not depart from them.

 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
iniquity.

 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

 And the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon
the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

 For thou art my lamp, O LORD and the LORD will lighten my
darkness.

 For by thee I have run through a troop by my God have I leaped
over a wall.

 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
 God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect.

 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet and setteth me upon my high
places.

 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms.

 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy
gentleness hath made me great.

 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
slip.

 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
again until I had consumed them.

 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
arise yea, they are fallen under my feet.

 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose
up against me hast thou subdued under me.

 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
destroy them that hate me.

 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but
he answered them not.

 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.

 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which I knew not
shall serve me.

 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear,
they shall be obedient unto me.

 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their
close places.

 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God
of the rock of my salvation.

 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
under me.

 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast
lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast
delivered me from the violent man.

 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

 He is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to
his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God
of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,  The Spirit of
the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.

 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of
the earth by clear shining after rain.

 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure for this is all
my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.

 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
away, because they cannot be taken with hands  But the man that
shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;
and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.

 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had The
Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same
was Adino the Eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom
he slew at one time.

 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that
were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were
gone away  He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand
was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword and the LORD wrought a
great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to
spoil.

 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of
ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the Philistines.

 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
slew the Philistines and the LORD wrought a great victory.

 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam and the troop of the
Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!   And
the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and
drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and
took it, and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink
thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.

 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this
is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?
therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty
men.

 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and
slew them, and had the name among three.

 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab he
went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow
 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man and the Egyptian had a
spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked
the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
among three mighty men.

 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
the first three. And David set him over his guard.

 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the
Harodite,  Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,  Zalmon
the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,  Heleb the son of Baanah,
a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children
of Benjamin,  Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of
Gaash,  Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the
son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,  Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the
Arbite,  Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the
son of Zeruiah,  Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,  Uriah
the Hittite thirty and seven in all.

 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and
he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.

 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to
Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the
people.

 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of
my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in
this thing?   Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against
Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains
of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
people of Israel.

 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right
side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and
toward Jazer  Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of
Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,  And
came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites,
and of the Canaanites and they went out to the south of Judah, even
to Beersheba.

 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
king and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that
drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
people.

And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have
done and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy
servant; for I have done very foolishly.

 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came
unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,  Go and say unto
David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one
of them, that I may do it unto thee.

 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee
three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that
there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what
answer I shall return to him that sent me.

 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait let us fall now
into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great and let me not
fall into the hand of man.

 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even
to the time appointed and there died of the people from Dan even to
Beersheba seventy thousand men.

 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel
that destroyed the people, It is enough stay now thine hand. And the
angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.

 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly but
these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be
against me, and against my father's house.

 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.

 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
commanded.

 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on
toward him and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on
his face upon the ground.

 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build
an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.

 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer
up what seemeth good unto him behold, here be oxen for burnt
sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen
for wood.

 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And
Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of
thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my
God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the
threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land,
and the plague was stayed from Israel.




The First Book of the Kings

Commonly Called

The Third Book of the Kings


 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my
lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king, and
let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the
king may get heat.

 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
ministered to him but the king knew her not.

 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will
be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to
run before him.

 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why
hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother
bare him after Absalom.

 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
the priest and they following Adonijah helped him.

 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan
the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to
David, were not with Adonijah.

 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's
sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants  But Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother,
he called not.

 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?   Now therefore come,
let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine
own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.

 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not
thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly
Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
why then doth Adonijah reign?   Behold, while thou yet talkest
there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy
words.

 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the
king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the
king.

 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
king said, What wouldest thou?   And she said unto him, My lord,
thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying,
Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon
my throne.

 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
thou knowest it not  And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and
Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host but Solomon thy
servant hath he not called.

 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,
that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord
the king after him.

 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted
offenders.

 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet
also came in.

 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king
with his face to the ground.

 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?   For he is gone
down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of
the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink
before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.

 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.

 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed
it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king
after him?   Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba.
And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
redeemed my soul out of all distress,  Even as I sware unto thee
by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so
will I certainly do this day.

 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.

 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the
king.

 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring
him down to Gihon  And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the
prophet anoint him there king over Israel and blow ye with the
trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.

 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
throne; for he shall be king in my stead and I have appointed him to
be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
Amen the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king
David.

 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and
caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to
Gihon.

 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people
said, God save king Solomon.

 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the
sound of them.

 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the
trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an
uproar?   And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of
Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for
thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
David hath made Solomon king.

 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the
Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule
 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
king in Gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the
city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.

 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and
make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself
upon the bed.

 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even
seeing it.

 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose
up, and went every man his way.

 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
caught hold on the horns of the altar.

 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
Solomon for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,
saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his
servant with the sword.

 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be
found in him, he shall die.

 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon and Solomon said unto
him, Go to thine house.

 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
Solomon his son, saying,  I go the way of all the earth be thou
strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;  And keep the charge of
the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his
commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written
in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest,
and whithersoever thou turnest thyself  That the LORD may continue
his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take
heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and
with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the
throne of Israel.

 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner
the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and
shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his
girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his
feet.

 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
down to the grave in peace.

 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me
when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
when I went to Mahanaim but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I
sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with
the sword.

 Now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man, and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring
thou down to the grave with blood.

 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David.

 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years
seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned
he in Jerusalem.

 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
kingdom was established greatly.

 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.

 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,
Say on.

 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign howbeit the kingdom
is turned about, and is become my brother's for it was his from the
LORD.

 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
unto him, Say on.

 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he
will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to
wife.

 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto
her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the
king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.

 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,
say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother for I
will not say thee nay.

 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
brother to wife.

 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom
also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the
priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and
more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.

 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and
set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an
house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.

 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
and he fell upon him that he died.

 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death but I will not at
this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD
God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in
all wherein my father was afflicted.

 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;
that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning
the house of Eli in Shiloh.

 Then tidings came to Joab for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle
of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon
sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.

 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die
here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,
and thus he answered me.

 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood,
which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.

 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell
upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the
sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of
Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,
captain of the host of Judah.

 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
upon the head of his seed for ever but upon David, and upon his seed,
and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever
from the LORD.

 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
host and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.

 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence
any whither.

 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over
the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely
die thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good as my lord the
king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem
many days.

 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.
And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.

 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish
to seek his servants and Shimei went, and brought his servants from
Gath.

 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
Gath, and was come again.

 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,
Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have heard is good.

 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
commandment that I have charged thee with?   The king said
moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart
is privy to, that thou didst to David my father therefore the LORD
shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  And king Solomon
shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before
the LORD for ever.

 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established
in the hand of Solomon.

 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he
had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD,
and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no
house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his
father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.

 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the
great high place a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon
that altar.

 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and
God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and
in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast
kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to
sit on his throne, as it is this day.

 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out
or come in.

 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for
multitude.

 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
people, that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to
judge this thy so great a people?   And the speech pleased the
LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.

 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for
thyself understanding to discern judgment;  Behold, I have done
according to thy words lo, I have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.

 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both
riches, and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings
like unto thee all thy days.

 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy
days.

 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and
offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a
feast to all his servants.

 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
stood before him.

 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.

 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
that this woman was delivered also and we were together; there was no
stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.

 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
it.

 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead
child in my bosom.

 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it
was dead but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was
not my son, which I did bear.

 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the
dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the
living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.

 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
and thy son is the dead and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the
dead, and my son is the living.

 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
before the king.

 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
to the one, and half to the other.

 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her
the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it
be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and
in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof.

 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in
him, to do judgment.

 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
the priest,  Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;
Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host and Zadok and
Abiathar were the priests  And Azariah the son of Nathan was over
the officers and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and
the king's friend  And Ahishar was over the household and
Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.

 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year
made provision.

 And these are their names The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim 
The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and
Elonbethhanan  The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained
Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher  The son of Abinadab, in all
the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife
 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam
 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of
Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained
the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with
walls and brasen bars  Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim
 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
Solomon to wife  Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in
Aloth  Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar  Shimei
the son of Elah, in Benjamin  Geber the son of Uri was in the
country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and
of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the
land.

 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt they brought
presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour, and threescore measures of meal,  Ten fat oxen, and twenty
oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and
roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.

 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,
from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river
and he had peace on all sides round about him.

 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of
Solomon.

 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen.

 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month they
lacked nothing.

 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his
charge.

 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol and his fame was in
all nations round about.

 And he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a
thousand and five.

 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for
Hiram was ever a lover of David.

 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,  Thou knowest how that David
my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God
for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put
them under the soles of his feet.

 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD
my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom
I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto
my name.

 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee
will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt
appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can
skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that
he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which
hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.

 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for and I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.

 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea and I
will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt
receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for
my household.

 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
his desire.

 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food
to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave Solomon
to Hiram year by year.

 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him and there
was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league
together.

 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
was thirty thousand men.

 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses a
month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home and Adoniram was
over the levy.

 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;  Beside the chief
of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and
three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.

 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the
stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is
the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.

 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits.

 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten
cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of
the oracle and he made chambers round about  The nethermost
chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad,
and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the
house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be
fastened in the walls of the house.

 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer
nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in
building.

 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,
and out of the middle into the third.

 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
beams and boards of cedar.

 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,  Concerning
this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my
statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake
unto David thy father  And I will dwell among the children of
Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.

 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling and he
covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the
house with planks of fir.

 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it
within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.

 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
long.

 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
flowers all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the
ark of the covenant of the LORD.

 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof and
he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of
cedar.

 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made
a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid
it with gold.

 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid
with gold.

 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
ten cubits high.

 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.

 And the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of
one measure and one size.

 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
other cherub.

 And he set the cherubims within the inner house and they
stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the
one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the
other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the
house.

 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and
without.

 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
without.

 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree
the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm
trees.

 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
fourth part of the wall.

 And the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one
door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.

 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers
and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.

 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and
a row of cedar beams.

 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
laid, in the month Zif  And in the eleventh year, in the month
Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all
the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
seven years in building it.

 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
finished all his house.

 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,
with cedar beams upon the pillars.

 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on
forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light
in three ranks.

 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows and
light was against light in three ranks.

 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was
before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before
them.

 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the
floor to the other.

 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,
which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's
daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.

 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the
foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great
court.

 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,
and cedars.

 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the
house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was
a man of Tyre, a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom, and
understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to
king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece
and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.

 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops
of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and
the height of the other chapiter was five cubits  And nets of
checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were
upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for
the other chapiter.

 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter.

 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of
lily work in the porch, four cubits.

 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
above, over against the belly which was by the network and the
pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other
chapiter.

 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set
up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin and he set up
the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.

 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of
the pillars finished.

 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
other it was round all about, and his height was five cubits and a
line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing
it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about the knops were
cast in two rows, when it was cast.

 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and
three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them,
and all their hinder parts were inward.

 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies it contained
two thousand baths.

 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height
of it.

 And the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders,
and the borders were between the ledges  And on the borders that
were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims and upon the
ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were
certain additions made of thin work.

 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass and
the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were
undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit
but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit
and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their
borders, foursquare, not round.

 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit
and half a cubit.

 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel
their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,
were all molten.

 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base
and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the
borders thereof were of the same.

 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the
proportion of every one, and additions round about.

 After this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one
casting, one measure, and one size.

 Then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty
baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten
bases one laver.

 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on
the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of
the house eastward over against the south.

 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for
the house of the LORD  The two pillars, and the two bowls of the
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two
networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the
top of the pillars;  And four hundred pomegranates for the two
networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the
two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;  And the
ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;  And one sea, and twelve
oxen under the sea;  And the pots, and the shovels, and the
basons and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for
the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.

 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zarthan.

 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out.

 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
the LORD the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the
shewbread was,  And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the
right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers,
and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,  And the bowls, and the
snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure
gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house,
the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the
temple.

 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of
the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put
among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto
king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the
covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.

 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
ark.

 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,
even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.

 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep
and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,
even under the wings of the cherubims.

 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of
the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof
above.

 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen
without and there they are unto this day.

 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which
Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,  So that the
priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the
glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.

 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
thick darkness.

 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
for thee to abide in for ever.

 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
congregation of Israel (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with
his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,
saying,  Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out
of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an
house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my
people Israel.

 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
the name of the LORD God of Israel.

 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine
heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in
thine heart.

 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my
name.

 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of
Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of
the LORD God of Israel.

 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out
of the land of Egypt.

 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward
heaven  And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like
thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart
 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
it with thine hand, as it is this day.

 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a
man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children
take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked
before me.

 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I
have builded?   Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy
servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the
cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day
 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there that
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make
toward this place.

 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou
in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest, forgive.

 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar
in this house  Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy
servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and
confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this
house  Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
unto their fathers.

 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them  Then
hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy
people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should
walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people
for an inheritance.

 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege
them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever
sickness there be;  What prayer and supplication soever be made by
any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the
plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house
 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,
and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest;
(for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of
men;)  That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,
but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;  (For they
shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy
stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all
that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth
may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that
they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy
name.

 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city
which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy
name  Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their
supplication, and maintain their cause.

 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)
and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that
they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in
the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned,
and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;  And so
return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the
land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee
toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city
which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name
 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
dwelling place, and maintain their cause,  And forgive thy people
that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein
they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before
them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron
 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,
and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them
in all that they call for unto thee.

 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses
thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD
God.

 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the
altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up
to heaven.

 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a
loud voice, saying,  Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest
unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised there hath
not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the
hand of Moses his servant.

 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers let him
not leave us, nor forsake us  That he may incline our hearts unto
him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his
statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before
the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he
maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel
at all times, as the matter shall require  That all the people of
the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.

 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before
the LORD.

 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred
and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel
dedicated the house of the LORD.

 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
before the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings,
and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings because the
brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the
burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
offerings.

 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of
Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even
fourteen days.

 On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the
king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the
goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel
his people.

 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire
which he was pleased to do,  That the LORD appeared to Solomon the
second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.

 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
supplication, that thou hast made before me I have hallowed this
house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine
eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I
have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments 
Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,
as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a
man upon the throne of Israel.

 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I
have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them
 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast
out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people  And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth
by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?   And
they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who
brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken
hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them
therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.

 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that
then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
given him; and they pleased him not.

 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.

 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for
to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the
wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and
given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.

 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,  And
Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,  And all the
cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and
cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in
Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of
Israel,  Their children that were left after them in the land,
whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy,
upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen but
they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his
captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that
wrought in the work.

 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
house which Solomon had built for her then did he build Millo.

 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished
the house.

 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard
questions.

 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones and when
she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her
heart.

 And Solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing
hid from the king, which he told her not.

 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and
the house that he had built,  And the meat of his table, and the
sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and
their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up
unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had
seen it and, behold, the half was not told me thy wisdom and
prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee
on the throne of Israel because the LORD loved Israel for ever,
therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.

 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
of spices very great store, and precious stones there came no more
such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to
king Solomon.

 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious
stones.

 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for
singers there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.

 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal
bounty.

So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.

 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
hundred threescore and six talents of gold,  Beside that he had
of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of
all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.

 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six
hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of
gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the
forest of Lebanon.

 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
with the best gold.

 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,
and two lions stood beside the stays.

 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom.

 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all
the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;
none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of
Solomon.

 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
Hiram once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold,
and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
and for wisdom.

 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
God had put in his heart.

 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and
mules, a rate year by year.

 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had
a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,
whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at
Jerusalem.

 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for
abundance.

 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn the
king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for
all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they
bring them out by their means.

 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
Zidonians, and Hittites  Of the nations concerning which the LORD
said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither
shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart
after their gods Solomon clave unto these in love.

 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines and his wives turned away his heart.

 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with
the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.

 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
after the LORD, as did David his father.

 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination
of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the
abomination of the children of Ammon.

 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 
And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
after other gods but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.

 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done
of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I
have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and
will give it to thy servant.

 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
father's sake but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake
which I have chosen.

 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
Edomite he was of the king's seed in Edom.

 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had
smitten every male in Edom;  (For six months did Joab remain
there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom) 
That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with
him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.

 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran and they took
men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king
of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and
gave him land.

 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes
the queen.

 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house and Genubath was in Pharaoh's
household among the sons of Pharaoh.

 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,
Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.

 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
answered, Nothing howbeit let me go in any wise.

 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah  And
he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David
slew them of Zobah and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and
reigned in Damascus.

 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
beside the mischief that Hadad did and he abhorred Israel, and
reigned over Syria.

 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even
he lifted up his hand against the king.

 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
king Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of
David his father.

 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and Solomon
seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over
all the charge of the house of Joseph.

 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in
the field  And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him,
and rent it in twelve pieces  And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee
ten pieces for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will
rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes
to thee  (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's
sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of
all the tribes of Israel)  Because that they have forsaken me,
and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh
the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,
and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine
eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his
father.

 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but I
will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's
sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes
 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give
it unto thee, even ten tribes.

 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have
chosen me to put my name there.

 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that
thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to
keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I
will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,
and will give Israel unto thee.

 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.

 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt
until the death of Solomon.

 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
was forty years.

 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
of David his father and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

 And Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel were come to Shechem
to make him king.

 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet
in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king
Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)  That they sent and called
him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake
unto Rehoboam, saying,  Thy father made our yoke grievous now
therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy
yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again
to me. And the people departed.

 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that
I may answer this people?   And they spake unto him, saying, If
thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them,
and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
servants for ever.

 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and
which stood before him  And he said unto them, What counsel give
ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make
the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?   And the
young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus
shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy
father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus
shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my
father's loins.

 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will
add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will
chastise you with scorpions.

 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
men's counsel that they gave him;  And spake to them after the
counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and
I will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips, but
I will chastise you with scorpions.

 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause
was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD
spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?
neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse to your tents, O
Israel now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto
their tents.

 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king
Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem.

 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and
made him king over all Israel there was none that followed the house
of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore
thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house
of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto
all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,
saying,  Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight
against your brethren the children of Israel return every man to his
house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word
of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the
LORD.

 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;
and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to
the house of David  If this people go up to do sacrifice in the
house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people
turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem
behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt.

 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

 And this thing became a sin for the people went to worship
before the one, even unto Dan.

 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and
he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the
calves that he had made and he placed in Bethel the priests of the
high places which he had made.

 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had
devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of
Israel and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of
the LORD unto Bethel and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.

 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,
O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born
unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer
the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's
bones shall be burnt upon thee.

 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which
the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes
that are upon it shall be poured out.

 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put
forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,
which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it
in again to him.

 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of
the LORD.

 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now
the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be
restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the
king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.

 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor
drink water in this place  For so was it charged me by the word
of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by
the same way that thou camest.

 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came
to Bethel.

 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and
told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in
Bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told
also to their father.

 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons
had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.

 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
him the ass and he rode thereon,  And went after the man of God,
and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him, Art thou the
man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.

 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee
neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place
 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no
bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou
camest.

 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with
thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he
lied unto him.

 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
drank water.

 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of
the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back  And he
cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the
LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast
not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of
the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;
thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.

 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom
he had brought back.

 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him
and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion
also stood by the carcase.

 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,
and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the
city where the old prophet dwelt.

 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the
word of the LORD therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,
which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake unto him.

 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
saddled him.

 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the
carcase, nor torn the ass.

 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid
it upon the ass, and brought it back and the old prophet came to the
city, to mourn and to bury him.

 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over
him, saying, Alas, my brother!   And it came to pass, after he
had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead,
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my
bones beside his bones  For the saying which he cried by the
word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the
houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall
surely come to pass.

 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places
whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests
of the high places.

 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get
thee to Shiloh behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me
that I should be king over this people.

 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
honey, and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the
child.

 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes
were set by reason of his age.

 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick thus and
thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be, when she cometh in,
that she shall feign herself to be another woman.

 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy
tidings.

 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch
as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my
people Israel,  And rent the kingdom away from the house of David,
and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who
kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
that only which was right in mine eyes;  But hast done evil above
all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other
gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me
behind thy back  Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the
house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will
take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away
dung, till it be all gone.

 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the
LORD hath spoken it.

 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house and when thy
feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him for he only of
Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some
good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.

 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day but what? even now.

 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he
gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river,
because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.

 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who
did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah and
when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;  And
they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the
prophet.

 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.

 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years
and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.

 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out
of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's
name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all
that their fathers had done.

 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
every high hill, and under every green tree.

 And there were also sodomites in the land and they did
according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast
out before the children of Israel.

 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem  And he took
away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the
king's house; he even took away all and he took away all the shields
of gold which Solomon had made.

 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept
the door of the king's house.

 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
chamber.

 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.

 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an
Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
reigned Abijam over Judah.

 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
before him and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as
the heart of David his father.

 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a
lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish
Jerusalem  Because David did that which was right in the eyes of
the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him
all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the
Hittite.

 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of
his life.

 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And
there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
city of David and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa
over Judah.

 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did
David his father.

 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
the idols that his fathers had made.

 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her
idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

 But the high places were not removed nevertheless Asa's heart
was perfect with the LORD all his days.

 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and
the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD,
silver, and gold, and vessels.

 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
their days.

 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king
of Judah.

 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's
house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king Asa
sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of
Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,  There is a league between
me and thee, and between my father and thy father behold, I have sent
unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with
Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon,
and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of
Naphtali.

 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was
exempted and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them
Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that
he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time
of his old age he was diseased in his feet.

 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
in the city of David his father and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in
his stead.

 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the
second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.

 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which
belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to
Gibbethon.

 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,
and reigned in his stead.

 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he
had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he
spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite  Because of the sins
of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his
provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.

 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
their days.

 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.

 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
Baasha, saying,  Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and
made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the
way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me
to anger with their sins;  Behold, I will take away the posterity
of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house
like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.

 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?   So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in
Tirzah and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for
all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to
anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam;
and because he killed him.

 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the
son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house
of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha he left him not
one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his
friends.

 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the
word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.

 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking
the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against
Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
conspired, and hath also slain the king wherefore all Israel made
Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.

 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
they besieged Tirzah.

 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's
house over him with fire, and died.

 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did,
to make Israel to sin.

 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel?   Then were the people of Israel divided into
two parts half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to
make him king; and half followed Omri.

 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
that followed Tibni the son of Ginath so Tibni died, and Omri
reigned.

 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
reign over Israel, twelve years six years reigned he in Tirzah.

 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which
he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
than all that were before him.

 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of
Israel to anger with their vanities.

 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Israel?   So Omri slept with his fathers, and was
buried in Samaria and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel and Ahab the son of Omri
reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above
all that were before him.

 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to
walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife
Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and
served Baal, and worshipped him.

 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
he had built in Samaria.

 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God
of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho he laid the
foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates
thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,
there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,  Get thee
hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,
that is before Jordan.

 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD for he
went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
because there had been no rain in the land.

 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,  Arise, get
thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there behold,
I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate
of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks
and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
in a vessel, that I may drink.

 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but
an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse and,
behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for
me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.

 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said
but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and
after make for thee and for thy son.

 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall
not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the
LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she,
and he, and her house, did eat many days.

 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil
fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.

 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so
sore, that there was no breath left in him.

 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and
to slay my son?   And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he
took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he
abode, and laid him upon his own bed.

 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her
son?   And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and
cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
child's soul come into him again.

 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
child came into him again, and he revived.

 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother and Elijah
said, See, thy son liveth.

 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a
man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.

 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab;
and I will send rain upon the earth.

 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
famine in Samaria.

 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly  For it was so, when Jezebel
cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred
prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
water.)   And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
fountains of water, and unto all brooks peradventure we may find
grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the
beasts.

 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it Ahab
went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him and he
knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord
Elijah?   And he answered him, I am go, tell thy lord, Behold,
Elijah is here.

 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?   As the LORD thy God
liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent
to seek thee and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of
the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.

 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that
the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so
when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me
but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.

 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets
by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?   And now
thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here and he shall
slay me.

 In the LORD put I my trust how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird
to your mountain?

 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow
upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven
his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

 The LORD trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth.

 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup.

 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth
behold the upright.



 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
among the children of men.

 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering
lips and with a double heart do they speak.

 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
speaketh proud things

 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our
own who is lord over us?

 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that
puffeth at him.

 The words of the LORD are pure words as silver tried in a
furnace of earth, purified seven times.

 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever.

 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.



 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
thou hide thy face from me?

 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God lighten mine eyes, lest I
sleep the sleep of death;

 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that
trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation.

 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with
me.



 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth
good.

 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

 There were they in great fear for God is in the generation of
the righteous.

 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his
refuge.

 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the
LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.



 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy
holy hill?

 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
speaketh the truth in his heart.

 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them
that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth
not.

 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.



 Preserve me, O God for in thee do I put my trust.

 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord my
goodness extendeth not to thee;

 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in
whom is all my delight.

 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god
their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their
names into my lips.

 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou
maintainest my lot.

 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
goodly heritage.

 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel my reins also
instruct me in the night seasons.

 I have set the LORD always before me because he is at my right
hand, I shall not be moved.

 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also
shall rest in hope.

 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

 Thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness
of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.



 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
behold the things that are equal.

 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my
mouth shall not transgress.

 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept
me from the paths of the destroyer.

 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God incline
thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up
against them.

 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy
wings,

 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
compass me about.

 They are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak
proudly.

 They have now compassed us in our steps they have set their
eyes bowing down to the earth;

 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
young lion lurking in secret places.

 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down deliver my soul
from the wicked, which is thy sword

 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest
with thy hid treasure they are full of children, and leave the rest
of their substance to their babes.

 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness I shall be
satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.



 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,
my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
salvation, and my high tower.

 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised so shall
I be saved from mine enemies.

 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid.

 The sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death
prevented me.

 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God he
heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even
into his ears.

 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured coals were kindled by it.

 He bowed the heavens also, and came down and darkness was under
his feet.

 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly yea, he did fly upon the
wings of the wind.

 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
hail stones and coals of fire.

 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his
voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
lightnings, and discomfited them.

 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils.

 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated
me for they were too strong for me.

 They prevented me in the day of my calamity but the LORD was my
stay.

 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
because he delighted in me.

 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.

 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
statutes from me.

 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
iniquity.

 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward.

 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
high looks.

 For thou wilt light my candle the LORD my God will enlighten my
darkness.

 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
leaped over a wall.

 As for God, his way is perfect the word of the LORD is tried
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
perfect.

 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high
places.

 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms.

 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy
right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.

 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them neither did I
turn again till they were consumed.

 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are
fallen under my feet.

 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me.

 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
destroy them that hate me.

 They cried, but there was none to save them even unto the LORD,
but he answered them not.

 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind I did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom I have not
known shall serve me.

 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me the strangers
shall submit themselves unto me.

 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
places.

 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
salvation be exalted.

 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

 He delivereth me from mine enemies yea, thou liftest me up
above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the
violent man.

 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.



 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
his handywork.

 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge.

 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth
as a strong man to run a race.

 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul the
testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart the
commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever the judgments
of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

 Moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them
there is great reward.

 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
faults.

 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not
have dominion over me then shall I be upright, and I shall be
innocent from the great transgression.

 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.



 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of
Jacob defend thee;

 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
Zion;

 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Selah.

 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
counsel.

 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we
will set up our banners the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses but we will remember
the name of the LORD our God.

 They are brought down and fallen but we are risen, and stand
upright.

 Save, LORD let the king hear us when we call.



 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation
how greatly shall he rejoice!

 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden
the request of his lips. Selah.

 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou
settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
days for ever and ever.

 His glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him.

 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance.

 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the
most High he shall not be moved.

 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall
find out those that hate thee.

 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger
the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour
them.

 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of men.

 For they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous
device, which they are not able to perform.

 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt
make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.

 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength so will we sing
and praise thy power.



 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the
night season, and am not silent.

 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

 Our fathers trusted in thee they trusted, and thou didst deliver
them.

 They cried unto thee, and were delivered they trusted in thee,
and were not confounded.

 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
the people.

 All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip,
they shake the head, saying,

 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him let him deliver
him, seeing he delighted in him.

 But thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me
hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

 I was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my God from my
mother's belly.

 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
help.

 Many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of Bashan have beset
me round.

 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
roaring lion.

 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint
my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth
to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

 For dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have
inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet.

 I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me.

 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

 But be not thou far from me, O LORD O my strength, haste thee
to help me.

 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
dog.

 Save me from the lion's mouth for thou hast heard me from the
horns of the unicorns.

 I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee.

 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried
unto him, he heard.

 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation I will pay
my vows before them that fear him.

 The meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the LORD
that seek him your heart shall live for ever.

 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD
and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

 For the kingdom is the LORD's and he is the governor among the
nations.

 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they
that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive
his own soul.

 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
generation.

 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
people that shall be born, that he hath done this.



 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside
the still waters.

 He restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.

 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me.

 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
life and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.



 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
they that dwell therein.

 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the
floods.

 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in
his holy place?

 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted
up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
from the God of his salvation.

 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face,
O Jacob. Selah.

 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD
mighty in battle.

 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of
glory. Selah.



 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

 O my God, I trust in thee let me not be ashamed, let not mine
enemies triumph over me.

 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause.

 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me for thou art the God of my
salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
for they have been ever of old.

 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O
LORD.

 Good and upright is the LORD therefore will he teach sinners in
the way.

 The meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach
his way.

 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies.

 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
great.

 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose.

 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
earth.

 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
shew them his covenant.

 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
out of the net.

 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
afflicted.

 The troubles of my heart are enlarged O bring thou me out of my
distresses.

 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with
cruel hatred.

 O keep my soul, and deliver me let me not be ashamed; for I put
my trust in thee.

 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.



 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity I have
trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes and I have walked in
thy truth.

 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
dissemblers.

 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
with the wicked.

 I will wash mine hands in innocency so will I compass thine
altar, O LORD

 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
all thy wondrous works.

 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
where thine honour dwelleth.

 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men

 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
bribes.

 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity redeem me, and be
merciful unto me.

 My foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will I
bless the LORD.



 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to
eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear
though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to
behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in
the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon
a rock.

 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
about me therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me,
and answer me.

 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy
face, LORD, will I seek.

 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger
thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.

 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take
me up.

 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
of mine enemies.

 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false
witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the
LORD in the land of the living.

 Wait on the LORD be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
thine heart wait, I say, on the LORD.



 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me lest,
if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I
lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in
their hearts.

 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
wickedness of their endeavours give them after the work of their
hands; render to them their desert.

 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation
of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.

 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
supplications.

 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,
and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my
song will I praise him.

 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
anointed.

 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance feed them also, and
lift them up for ever.



 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
strength.

 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD
in the beauty of holiness.

 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters the God of glory
thundereth the LORD is upon many waters.

 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full
of majesty.

 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
the cedars of Lebanon.

 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like
a young unicorn.

 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh.

 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth
the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.

 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
ever.

 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless
his people with peace.



 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over me.

 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast
kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness.

 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life
weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong
thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me LORD, be thou my helper.

 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put
off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent.

O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.



 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed
deliver me in thy righteousness.

 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily be thou my strong
rock, for an house of defence to save me.

 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
sake lead me, and guide me.

 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for
thou art my strength.

 Into thine hand I commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
God of truth.

 I have hated them that regard lying vanities but I trust in the
LORD.

 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered
my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set
my feet in a large room.

 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble mine eye is
consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing my
strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me
without fled from me.

 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind I am like a broken
vessel.

 For I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side
while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away
my life.

 But I trusted in thee, O LORD I said, Thou art my God.

 My times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies, and from them that persecute me.

 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy
mercies' sake.

 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee let
the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.

 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee
before the sons of men!

 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
strife of tongues.

 Blessed be the LORD for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city.

 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
unto thee.

 O love the LORD, all ye his saints for the LORD preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
that hope in the LORD.



 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
covered.

 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
in whose spirit there is no guile.

 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
the day long.

 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is
turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they
shall not come nigh unto him.

 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
go I will guide thee with mine eye.

 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
they come near unto thee.

 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the
LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous and shout for
joy, all ye that are upright in heart.



 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous for praise is comely for the
upright.

 Praise the LORD with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings.

 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in
truth.

 He loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD.

 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host
of them by the breath of his mouth.

 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth
up the depth in storehouses.

 Let all the earth fear the LORD let all the inhabitants of the
world stand in awe of him.

 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.

 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he
maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
heart to all generations.

 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom
he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.

 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
inhabitants of the earth.

 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
works.

 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man
is not delivered by much strength.

 An horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver
any by his great strength.

 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy;

 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
famine.

 Our soul waiteth for the LORD he is our help and our shield.

 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
his holy name.

 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.



 I will bless the LORD at all times his praise shall continually
be in my mouth.

 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad.

 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.

 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears.

 They looked unto him, and were lightened and their faces were
not ashamed.

 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
all his troubles.

 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
and delivereth them.

 O taste and see that the LORD is good blessed is the man that
trusteth in him.

 O fear the LORD, ye his saints for there is no want to them that
fear him.

 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger but they that seek
the LORD shall not want any good thing.

 Come, ye children, hearken unto me I will teach you the fear of
the LORD.

 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he
may see good?

 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their cry.

 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
the remembrance of them from the earth.

 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out
of all their troubles.

 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

 Many are the afflictions of the righteous but the LORD
delivereth him out of them all.

 He keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken.

 Evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous
shall be desolate.

 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them
that trust in him shall be desolate.



 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me fight
against them that fight against me.

 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
persecute me say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul
let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

 Let them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the
LORD chase them.

 Let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the LORD
persecute them.

 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which
without cause they have digged for my soul.

 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that
he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fall.

 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD it shall rejoice in his
salvation.

 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor
and the needy from him that spoileth him?

 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that
I knew not.

 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth I
humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own
bosom.

 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother I
bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
together yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me,
and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not

 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
their teeth.

 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
destructions, my darling from the lions.

 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation I will praise
thee among much people.

 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

 For they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters
against them that are quiet in the land.

 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
aha, our eye hath seen it.

 This thou hast seen, O LORD keep not silence O Lord, be not
far from me.

 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
my God and my Lord.

 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let
them not rejoice over me.

 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it let
them not say, We have swallowed him up.

 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour
that magnify themselves against me.

 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
cause yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise
all the day long.



 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there
is no fear of God before his eyes.

 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
found to be hateful.

 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off
to be wise, and to do good.

 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
reacheth unto the clouds.

 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are
a great deep O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

 For with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see
light.

 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
righteousness to the upright in heart.

 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand
of the wicked remove me.

 There are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down,
and shall not be able to rise.



 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity.

 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
green herb.

 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,
and verily thou shalt be fed.

 Delight thyself also in the LORD and he shall give thee the
desires of thine heart.

 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
bring it to pass.

 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday.

 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass.

 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise
to do evil.

 For evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the
LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be yea, thou
shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
themselves in the abundance of peace.

 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with
his teeth.

 The LORD shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is
coming.

 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to
cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright
conversation.

 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
shall be broken.

 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
many wicked.

 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the LORD
upholdeth the righteous.

 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance
shall be for ever.

 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of
famine they shall be satisfied.

 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
be as the fat of lambs they shall consume; into smoke shall they
consume away.

 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again but the righteous
sheweth mercy, and giveth.

 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they
that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD and he
delighteth in his way.

 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down for the LORD
upholdeth him with his hand.

 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they
are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
ever.

 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
talketh of judgment.

 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
slide.

 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he
is judged.

 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
like a green bay tree.

 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not yea, I sought him, but
he could not be found.

 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright for the end of
that man is peace.

 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of
the wicked shall be cut off.

 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD he is their
strength in the time of trouble.

 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them he shall deliver
them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.



 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure.

 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden
they are too heavy for me.

 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
long.

 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no
soundness in my flesh.

 I am feeble and sore broken I have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my heart.

 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
from thee.

 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me as for the light of
mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
kinsmen stand afar off.

 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they
that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all
the day long.

 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
openeth not his mouth.

 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no
reproofs.

 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me
when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.

 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong and they that
hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
because I follow the thing that good is.

 Forsake me not, O LORD O my God, be not far from me.

 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.



 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
tongue I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before
me.

 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my
sorrow was stirred.

 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned
then spake I with my tongue,

 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what
it is that I may know how frail I am.

 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is
as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is
altogether vanity.

Selah.

 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are
disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall
gather them.

 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

 Deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach
of the foolish.

 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

 Remove thy stroke away from me I am consumed by the blow of
thine hand.

 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is
vanity. Selah.

 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
peace at my tears for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as
all my fathers were.

 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and
be no more.



 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
heard my cry.

 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God
many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them, they are
more than can be numbered.

 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

 Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book it is written
of me,

 I delight to do thy will, O my God yea, thy law is within my
heart.

 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo, I
have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

 For innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are
more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me.

 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me O LORD, make haste to help
me.

 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that
wish me evil.

 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
me, Aha, aha.

 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let
such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me thou art
my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.



 Blessed is he that considereth the poor the LORD will deliver
him in time of trouble.

 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be
blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of
his enemies.

 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou
wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me heal my soul; for I have
sinned against thee.

 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
perish?

 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth
iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.

 All that hate me whisper together against me against me do they
devise my hurt.

 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him and now that
he lieth he shall rise up no more.

 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
may requite them.

 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
not triumph over me.

 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest
me before thy face for ever.

 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
everlasting. Amen, and Amen.



 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
after thee, O God.

 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God when shall I come
and appear before God?

 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually
say unto me, Where is thy God?

 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me for I had
gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with
the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in
me?  hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance.

 O my God, my soul is cast down within me therefore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the
hill Mizar.

 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me.

 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and
in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of
my life.

 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him, who is the
health of my countenance, and my God.



 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

 For thou art the God of my strength why dost thou cast me off?
why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

 O send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me; let them
bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy
yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope in God for I shall yet praise him, who is the health
of my countenance, and my God.



 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.

 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand, and thine
arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour
unto them.

 Thou art my King, O God command deliverances for Jacob.

 Through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will
we tread them under that rise up against us.

 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
shame that hated us.

 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.

Selah.

 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth
with our armies.

 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate
us spoil for themselves.

 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
scattered us among the heathen.

 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
wealth by their price.

 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
derision to them that are round about us.

 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head
among the people.

 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face
hath covered me,

 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason
of the enemy and avenger.

 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
from thy way;

 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
covered us with the shadow of death.

 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
hands to a strange god;

 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
heart.

 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted
as sheep for the slaughter.

 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
ever.

 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
and our oppression?

 For our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto
the earth.

 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.



 My heart is inditing a good matter I speak of the things which I
have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

 Thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into
thy lips therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and
thy majesty.

 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee
terrible things.

 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
whereby the people fall under thee.

 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy
kingdom is a right sceptre.

 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness therefore God,
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.

 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right
hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget
also thine own people, and thy father's house;

 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy Lord;
and worship thou him.

 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

 The king's daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of
wrought gold.

 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the
virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.

 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall
enter into the king's palace.

 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
make princes in all the earth.

 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.



 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved God shall
help her, and that right early.

 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice,
the earth melted.

 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
Selah.

 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
in the earth.

 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in
the fire.

 Be still, and know that I am God I will be exalted among the
heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
Selah.



 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice
of triumph.

 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all
the earth.

 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
feet.

 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob
whom he loved. Selah.

 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
trumpet.

 Sing praises to God, sing praises sing praises unto our King,
sing praises.

 For God is the King of all the earth sing ye praises with
understanding.

 God reigneth over the heathen God sitteth upon the throne of his
holiness.

 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people
of the God of Abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto God
he is greatly exalted.



 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our
God, in the mountain of his holiness.

 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
hasted away.

 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
travail.

 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
hosts, in the city of our God God will establish it for ever. Selah.

 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
temple.

 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of
the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness.

 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
because of thy judgments.

 Walk about Zion, and go round about her tell the towers
thereof.

 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
tell it to the generation following.

 For this God is our God for ever and ever he will be our guide
even unto death.



 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
world

 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
shall be of understanding.

 I will incline mine ear to a parable I will open my dark saying
upon the harp.

 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of
my heels shall compass me about?

 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches;

 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God
a ransom for him

 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
ever)

 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their
lands after their own names.

 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the
beasts that perish.

 This their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their
sayings. Selah.

 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;
and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and
their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he
shall receive me. Selah.

 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
house is increased;

 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall
not descend after him.

 Though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise
thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
see light.

 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts
that perish.



 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth
from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence a fire shall
devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that
he may judge his people.

 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
covenant with me by sacrifice.

 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God is judge
himself. Selah.

 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify
against thee I am God, even thy God.

 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
offerings, to have been continually before me.

 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy
folds.

 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
thousand hills.

 I know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of
the field are mine.

 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee for the world is mine,
and the fulness thereof.

 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
High

 And call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.

 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
thee.

 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
hast been partaker with adulterers.

 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother's son.

 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such an one as thyself but I will reprove thee,
and set them in order before thine eyes.

 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
pieces, and there be none to deliver.

 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth
his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.



 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions.

 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

 For I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before
me.

 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
clear when thou judgest.

 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
conceive me.

 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean wash me, and I shall
be whiter than snow.

 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.

 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me.

 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
from me.

 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
free spirit.

 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.

 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
praise.

 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it thou
delightest not in burnt offering.

 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion build thou the walls of
Jerusalem.

 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer
bullocks upon thine altar.



 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness
of God endureth continually.

 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
deceitfully.

 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
righteousness. Selah.

 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of
the land of the living. Selah.

 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him

 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness.

 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in
the mercy of God for ever and ever.

 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it and I
will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.



 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
they, and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth
good.

 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

 Every one of them is gone back they are altogether become
filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
as they eat bread they have not called upon God.

 There were they in great fear, where no fear was for God hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put
them to shame, because God hath despised them.

 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and
Israel shall be glad.



 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after
my soul they have not set God before them. Selah.

 Behold, God is mine helper the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul.

 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy
truth.

 I will freely sacrifice unto thee I will praise thy name, O
LORD; for it is good.

 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies.



 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
supplication.

 Attend unto me, and hear me I mourn in my complaint, and make a
noise;

 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of
the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

 My heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me.

 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
overwhelmed me.

 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
away, and be at rest.

 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
Selah.

 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues for I have seen
violence and strife in the city.

 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

 Wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not
from her streets.

 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
against me; then I would have hid myself from him

 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance.

 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God
in company.

 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell
for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud
and he shall hear my voice.

 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
against me for there were many with me.

 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.

Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
him he hath broken his covenant.

 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in
his heart his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.

 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee he
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days; but I will trust in thee.



 Be merciful unto me, O God for man would swallow me up; he
fighting daily oppresseth me.

 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that
fight against me, O thou most High.

 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
not fear what flesh can do unto me.

 Every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me
for evil.

 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark
my steps, when they wait for my soul.

 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
people, O God.

 Thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle
are they not in thy book?

 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back this I
know; for God is for me.

 In God will I praise his word in the LORD will I praise his
word.

 In God have I put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do
unto me.

 Thy vows are upon me, O God I will render praises unto thee.

 For thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou
deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light
of the living?



 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me for my soul
trusteth in thee yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my
refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
things for me.

 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and
his truth.

 My soul is among lions and I lie even among them that are set on
fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and
their tongue a sharp sword.

 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above
all the earth.

 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down
they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
fallen themselves. Selah.

 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed I will sing and give
praise.

 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp I myself will awake
early.

 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people I will sing unto
thee among the nations.

 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
clouds.

 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens let thy glory be
above all the earth.



 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
uprightly, O ye sons of men?

 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your
hands in the earth.

 The wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as
they be born, speaking lies.

 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the
deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never
so wisely.

 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth break out the great
teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

 Let them melt away as waters which run continually when he
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away like
the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.

 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as
with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he
shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
righteous verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.



 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God defend me from them that
rise up against me.

 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody
men.

 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered
against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

 They run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help
me, and behold.

 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to
visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.
Selah.

 They return at evening they make a noise like a dog, and go
round about the city.

 Behold, they belch out with their mouth swords are in their
lips for who, say they, doth hear?

 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
heathen in derision.

 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee for God is my
defence.

 The God of my mercy shall prevent me God shall let me see my
desire upon mine enemies.

 Slay them not, lest my people forget scatter them by thy power;
and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them
even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they
speak.

 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be and
let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.
Selah.

 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a
dog, and go round about the city.

 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not
satisfied.

 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the
day of my trouble.

 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing for God is my defence,
and the God of my mercy.



 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast
been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it heal
the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to
drink the wine of astonishment.

 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed because of the truth. Selah.

 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and
hear me.

 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe Philistia,
triumph thou because of me.

 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom?

 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,
which didst not go out with our armies?

 Give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man.

 Through God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread
down our enemies.



 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
enemy.

 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever I will trust in the
covert of thy wings. Selah.

 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows thou hast given me the
heritage of those that fear thy name.

 Thou wilt prolong the king's life and his years as many
generations.

 He shall abide before God for ever O prepare mercy and truth,
which may preserve him.

 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
perform my vows.



 Truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation.

 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
not be greatly moved.

 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering
fence.

 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency they
delight in lies they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.
Selah.

 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

 He only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence; I shall
not be moved.

 In God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength, and
my refuge, is in God.

 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
him God is a refuge for us. Selah.

 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
lie to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than
vanity.

 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery if
riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
belongeth unto God.

 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy for thou renderest to
every man according to his work.



 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth
for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where
no water is;

 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
sanctuary.

 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
praise thee.

 Thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in
thy name.

 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips

 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
night watches.

 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
wings will I rejoice.

 My soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me.

 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
lower parts of the earth.

 They shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes.

 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be
stopped.



 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer preserve my life from fear of
the enemy.

 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
insurrection of the workers of iniquity

 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot
their arrows, even bitter words

 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they
shoot at him, and fear not.

 They encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of
laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search
both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.

 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
wounded.

 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all
that see them shall flee away.

 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
they shall wisely consider of his doing.

 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;
and all the upright in heart shall glory.



 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion and unto thee shall the
vow be performed.

 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

 Iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions, thou
shalt purge them away.

 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with
the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.

 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of
our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
and of them that are afar off upon the sea

 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
with power

 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,
and the tumult of the people.

 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
rejoice.

 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it thou greatly enrichest
it with the river of God, which is full of water thou preparest them
corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly thou settlest the
furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers thou blessest the
springing thereof.

 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
fatness.

 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness and the little
hills rejoice on every side.

 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.



 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands

 Sing forth the honour of his name make his praise glorious.

 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto
thee.

 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they
shall sing to thy name. Selah.

 Come and see the works of God he is terrible in his doing toward
the children of men.

 He turned the sea into dry land they went through the flood on
foot there did we rejoice in him.

 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations let
not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to
be heard

 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
moved.

 For thou, O God, hast proved us thou hast tried us, as silver
is tried.

 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
loins.

 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
place.

 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings I will pay thee
my vows,

 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was
in trouble.

 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
hath done for my soul.

 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
tongue.

 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me

 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
my prayer.

 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
mercy from me.



 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
shine upon us; Selah.

 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all
nations.

 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
thee.

 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge
the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.

 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
thee.

 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
God, shall bless us.

 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.



 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered let them also that
hate him flee before him.

 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away as wax melteth
before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God yea,
let them exceedingly rejoice.

 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name extol him that rideth
upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in
his holy habitation.

 God setteth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which
are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.

 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
march through the wilderness; Selah

 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God
even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou, O God, hast prepared
of thy goodness for the poor.

 The Lord gave the word great was the company of those that
published it.

 Kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home
divided the spoil.

 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in
Salmon.

 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
hill of Bashan.

 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth
to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
angels the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.

 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that
the LORD God might dwell among them.

 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
the God of our salvation. Selah.

 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
Lord belong the issues from death.

 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp
of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
people again from the depths of the sea

 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my
King, in the sanctuary.

 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
fountain of Israel.

 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah
and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of
Naphtali.

 Thy God hath commanded thy strength strengthen, O God, that
which thou hast wrought for us.

 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
unto thee.

 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with
the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of
silver scatter thou the people that delight in war.

 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
her hands unto God.

 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the
Lord; Selah

 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

 Ascribe ye strength unto God his excellency is over Israel, and
his strength is in the clouds.

 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places the God of
Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed
be God.



 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing I am come into
deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

 I am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while
I wait for my God.

 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
head they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are
mighty then I restored that which I took not away.

 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
thee.

 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O
God of Israel.

 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
face.

 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
mother's children.

 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
reproach.

 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
them.

 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
of the drunkards.

 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
time O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of
thy salvation.

 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink let me be
delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow
me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble
hear me speedily.

 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it deliver me because of
mine enemies.

 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour
mine adversaries are all before thee.

 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness and I
looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters,
but I found none.

 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink.

 Let their table become a snare before them and that which
should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
loins continually to shake.

 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them.

 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
tents.

 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

 Add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy
righteousness.

 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
written with the righteous.

 But I am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation, O God, set me up
on high.

 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
with thanksgiving.

 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
that hath horns and hoofs.

 The humble shall see this, and be glad and your heart shall
live that seek God.

 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.

 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
that moveth therein.

 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah that
they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that
love his name shall dwell therein.



 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.

 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let
them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
Aha, aha.

 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let
such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

 But I am poor and needy make haste unto me, O God thou art my
help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.



 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust let me never be put to
confusion.

 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape incline
thine ear unto me, and save me.

 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort
thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my
fortress.

 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD thou art my trust from my
youth.

 By thee have I been holden up from the womb thou art he that
took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually of
thee.

 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
the day.

 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
strength faileth.

 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel together,

 Saying, God hath forsaken him persecute and take him; for there
is none to deliver him.

 O God, be not far from me O my God, make haste for my help.

 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
hurt.

 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
more.

 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD I will make mention
of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have I
declared thy wondrous works.

 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power
to every one that is to come.

 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
things O God, who is like unto thee!

 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
earth.

 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my
God unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
soul, which thou hast redeemed.

 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long
for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my
hurt.



 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
the king's son.

 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
judgment.

 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
hills, by righteousness.

 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children
of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
throughout all generations.

 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that
water the earth.

 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace
so long as the moon endureth.

 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
unto the ends of the earth.

 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
enemies shall lick the dust.

 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the
kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall
serve him.

 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
and him that hath no helper.

 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
the needy.

 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and
precious shall their blood be in his sight.

 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
Sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall
he be praised.

 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon and they of
the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

 His name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as
long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall
call him blessed.

 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
wondrous things.

 And blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole
earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.



 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
heart.

 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
slipped.

 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
the wicked.

 For there are no bands in their death but their strength is
firm.

 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
like other men.

 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
covereth them as a garment.

 Their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart
could wish.

 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression they
speak loftily.

 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
walketh through the earth.

 Therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are
wrung out to them.

 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
most High?

 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
increase in riches.

 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
innocency.

 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
morning.

 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
generation of thy children.

 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
end.

 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst
them down into destruction.

 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
utterly consumed with terrors.

 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
shalt despise their image.

 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

 So foolish was I, and ignorant I was as a beast before thee.

 Nevertheless I am continually with thee thou hast holden me by
my right hand.

 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
to glory.

 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
that I desire beside thee.

 My flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever.

 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

 But it is good for me to draw near to God I have put my trust
in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.



 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger
smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the
rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,
wherein thou hast dwelt.

 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
their ensigns for signs.

 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
thick trees.

 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
and hammers.

 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together they
have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

 We see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is
there among us any that knoweth how long.

 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
blaspheme thy name for ever?

 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out
of thy bosom.

 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the
earth.

 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters.

 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to
be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up
mighty rivers.

 The day is thine, the night also is thine thou hast prepared
the light and the sun.

 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made
summer and winter.

 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that
the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

 Have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth
are full of the habitations of cruelty.

 O let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy
praise thy name.

 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause remember how the foolish
man reproacheth thee daily.

 Forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that
rise up against thee increaseth continually.



 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved I bear
up the pillars of it. Selah.

 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly and to the wicked,
Lift not up the horn

 Lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck.

 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
nor from the south.

 But God is the judge he putteth down one, and setteth up
another.

 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;
it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same but the dregs
thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink
them.

 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
Jacob.

 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted.



 In Judah is God known his name is great in Israel.

 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.

 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,
and the battle. Selah.

 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep and
none of the men of might have found their hands.

 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
cast into a dead sleep.

 Thou, even thou, art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry?

 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
feared, and was still,

 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
Selah.

 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of
wrath shalt thou restrain.

 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God let all that be round about
him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

 He shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the
kings of the earth.



 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and
he gave ear unto me.

 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord my sore ran in the
night, and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted.

 I remembered God, and was troubled I complained, and my spirit
was overwhelmed. Selah.

 Thou holdest mine eyes waking I am so troubled that I cannot
speak.

 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

 I call to remembrance my song in the night I commune with mine
own heart and my spirit made diligent search.

 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
more?

 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
evermore?

 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his
tender mercies? Selah.

 And I said, This is my infirmity but I will remember the years
of the right hand of the most High.

 I will remember the works of the LORD surely I will remember
thy wonders of old.

 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary who is so great a God as
our God?

 Thou art the God that doest wonders thou hast declared thy
strength among the people.

 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob
and Joseph. Selah.

 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
afraid the depths also were troubled.

 The clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine
arrows also went abroad.

 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings
lightened the world the earth trembled and shook.

 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
footsteps are not known.

 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
Aaron.



 Give ear, O my people, to my law incline your ears to the words
of my mouth.

 I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of
old

 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his
wonderful works that he hath done.

 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them
known to their children

 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their
children

 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
of God, but keep his commandments

 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit was not stedfast with God.

 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned
back in the day of battle.

 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
law;

 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made
the waters to stand as an heap.

 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
with a light of fire.

 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out
of the great depths.

 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
run down like rivers.

 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
in the wilderness.

 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
lust.

 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
in the wilderness?

 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for
his people?

 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth so a fire was
kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation

 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
doors of heaven,

 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
of the corn of heaven.

 Man did eat angels' food he sent them meat to the full.

 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power
he brought in the south wind.

 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea

 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
habitations.

 So they did eat, and were well filled for he gave them their
own desire;

 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
was yet in their mouths,

 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
wondrous works.

 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
in trouble.

 When he slew them, then they sought him and they returned and
enquired early after God.

 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
their redeemer.

 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
lied unto him with their tongues.

 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
stedfast in his covenant.

 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
destroyed them not yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did
not stir up all his wrath.

 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
away, and cometh not again.

 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
in the desert!

 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
of Israel.

 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
from the enemy.

 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
field of Zoan.

 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
they could not drink.

 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
and frogs, which destroyed them.

 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
labour unto the locust.

 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
with frost.

 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
hot thunderbolts.

 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,
but gave their life over to the pestilence;

 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
strength in the tabernacles of Ham

 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock.

 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies.

 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tents.

 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
his testimonies

 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they
were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved
him to jealousy with their graven images.

 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel

 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
placed among men;

 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
the enemy's hand.

 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with
his inheritance.

 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
given to marriage.

 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
lamentation.

 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
that shouteth by reason of wine.

 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a
perpetual reproach.

 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim

 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
which he hath established for ever.

 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
sheepfolds

 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.



 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of
the earth.

 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
there was none to bury them.

 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us.

 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy
burn like fire?

 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.

 O remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender
mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low.

 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name and
deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of
thy servants which is shed.

 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to
die;

 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.



 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.

 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
and come and save us.

 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall
be saved.

 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy people?

 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears
to drink in great measure.

 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies
laugh among themselves.

 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and
we shall be saved.

 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it.

 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep
root, and it filled the land.

 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedars.

 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
river.

 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
which pass by the way do pluck her?

 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
the field doth devour it.

 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts look down from heaven,
and behold, and visit this vine;

 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

 It is burned with fire, it is cut down they perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance.

 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of
man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

 So will not we go back from thee quicken us, and we will call
upon thy name.

 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and
we shall be saved.



 Sing aloud unto God our strength make a joyful noise unto the
God of Jacob.

 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
with the psaltery.

 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
our solemn feast day.

 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.

 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
through the land of Egypt where I heard a language that I understood
not.

 I removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered
from the pots.

 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee
in the secret place of thunder I proved thee at the waters of
Meribah.

Selah.

 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee O Israel, if
thou wilt hearken unto me;

 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship
any strange god.

 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
none of me.

 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust and they walked
in their own counsels.

 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
in my ways!

 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
against their adversaries.

 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
him but their time should have endured for ever.

 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and
with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.



 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among
the gods.

 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
wicked? Selah.

 Defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and
needy.

 Deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the
wicked.

 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most
High.

 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

 Arise, O God, judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all
nations.



 Keep not thou silence, O God hold not thy peace, and be not
still, O God.

 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head.

 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted
against thy hidden ones.

 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

 For they have consulted together with one consent they are
confederate against thee

 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
Hagarenes;

 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
inhabitants of Tyre;

 Assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of
Lot.

Selah.

 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
at the brook of Kison

 Which perished at Endor they became as dung for the earth.

 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb yea, all their
princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna

 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
possession.

 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
wind.

 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
mountains on fire;

 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
thy storm.

 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
LORD.

 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
put to shame, and perish

 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
the most high over all the earth.



 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of
hosts, my King, and my God.

 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still
praising thee. Selah.

 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are
the ways of them.

 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain
also filleth the pools.

 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
appeareth before God.

 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer give ear, O God of Jacob.
Selah.

 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
anointed.

 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather
be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness.

 For the LORD God is a sun and shield the LORD will give grace
and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly.

 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.



 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought
back the captivity of Jacob.

 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
all their sin. Selah.

 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from
the fierceness of thine anger.

 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
to cease.

 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
anger to all generations?

 Wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in
thee?

 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

 I will hear what God the LORD will speak for he will speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints but let them not turn again to
folly.

 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may
dwell in our land.

 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed each other.

 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
look down from heaven.

 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
yield her increase.

 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
of his steps.



 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me for I am poor and needy.

 Preserve my soul; for I am holy O thou my God, save thy servant
that trusteth in thee.

 Be merciful unto me, O Lord for I cry unto thee daily.

 Rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my soul.

 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
supplications.

 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee for thou wilt
answer me.

 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are
there any works like unto thy works.

 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things thou art God
alone.

 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth unite my
heart to fear thy name.

 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart and I will
glorify thy name for evermore.

 For great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my
soul from the lowest hell.

 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before
them.

 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
and be ashamed because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.



 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob.

 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me
behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.

 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her
and the highest himself shall establish her.

 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
man was born there. Selah.

 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there
all my springs are in thee.



 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
thee

 Let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry;

 For my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto
the grave.

 I am counted with them that go down into the pit I am as a man
that hath no strength

 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand.

 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all
thy waves. Selah.

 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made
me an abomination unto them I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction LORD, I have called
daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
praise thee? Selah.

 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
faithfulness in destruction?

 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in
the land of forgetfulness?

 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
prayer prevent thee.

 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
from me?

 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while I suffer
thy terrors I am distracted.

 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
about together.

 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
acquaintance into darkness.



 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever with my mouth
will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever thy
faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
servant,

 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
all generations. Selah.

 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD thy
faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to
thy faithfulness round about thee?

 Thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise,
thou stillest them.

 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine as for the world
and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

 The north and the south thou hast created them Tabor and Hermon
shall rejoice in thy name.

 Thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand, and high is thy
right hand.

 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and
truth shall go before thy face.

 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall
walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy
righteousness shall they be exalted.

 For thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favour our
horn shall be exalted.

 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
king.

 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have
laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of
the people.

 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed
him

 With whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall
strengthen him.

 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
afflict him.

 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
that hate him.

 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my
name shall his horn be exalted.

 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
rivers.

 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
of my salvation.

 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the
earth.

 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
stand fast with him.

 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
the days of heaven.

 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
iniquity with stripes.

 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips.

 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.

 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before
me.

 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
witness in heaven. Selah.

 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
thine anointed.

 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant thou hast
profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
strong holds to ruin.

 All that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his
neighbours.

 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice.

 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
him to stand in the battle.

 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
the ground.

 The days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him
with shame. Selah.

 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
burn like fire?

 Remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men
in vain?

 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest
unto David in thy truth?

 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.



 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
thou art God.

 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children
of men.

 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
past, and as a watch in the night.

 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep in
the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it
is cut down, and withereth.

 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
troubled.

 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance.

 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years
as a tale that is told.

 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength
labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
fear, so is thy wrath.

 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom.

 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
servants.

 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
glad all our days.

 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
children.

 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands
establish thou it.



 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty.

 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress my God;
in him will I trust.

 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
from the noisome pestilence.

 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
arrow that flieth by day;

 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday.

 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked.

 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
most High, thy habitation;

 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling.

 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
all thy ways.

 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone.

 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
him I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him I will be with him
in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.



 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH

 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
faithfulness every night,

 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
the harp with a solemn sound.

 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work I will
triumph in the works of thy hands.

 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.

 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.

 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of
iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever

 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn I
shall be anointed with fresh oil.

 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.

 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow
like a cedar in Lebanon.

 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in
the courts of our God.

 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat
and flourishing;

 To shew that the LORD is upright he is my rock, and there is no
unrighteousness in him.



 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself the world
also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

 Thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting.

 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea,
than the mighty waves of the sea.

 Thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house, O
LORD, for ever.



 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.

 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth render a reward to the
proud.

 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
triumph?

 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
workers of iniquity boast themselves?

 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
heritage.

 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
Jacob regard it.

 Understand, ye brutish among the people and ye fools, when will
ye be wise?

 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
eye, shall he not see?

 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
him out of thy law;

 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until
the pit be digged for the wicked.

 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
forsake his inheritance.

 But judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the
upright in heart shall follow it.

 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand
up for me against the workers of iniquity?

 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
silence.

 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
my soul.

 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
frameth mischief by a law?

 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.

 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them
off.



 O come, let us sing unto the LORD let us make a joyful noise to
the rock of our salvation.

 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
joyful noise unto him with psalms.

 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

 In his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the
hills is his also.

 The sea is his, and he made it and his hands formed the dry
land.

 O come, let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the LORD
our maker.

 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the
sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day
of temptation in the wilderness

 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my
ways

 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
rest.



 O sing unto the LORD a new song sing unto the LORD, all the
earth.

 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from
day to day.

 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
people.

 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised he is to be
feared above all gods.

 For all the gods of the nations are idols but the LORD made the
heavens.

 Honour and majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his
sanctuary.

 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
LORD glory and strength.

 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name bring an
offering, and come into his courts.

 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness fear before him,
all the earth.

 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth the world also
shall be established that it shall not be moved he shall judge the
people righteously.

 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
roar, and the fulness thereof.

 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein then shall all
the trees of the wood rejoice

 Before the LORD for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
earth he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people
with his truth.



 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
isles be glad thereof.

 Clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and
judgment are the habitation of his throne.

 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.

 His lightnings enlightened the world the earth saw, and
trembled.

 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his
glory.

 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
themselves of idols worship him, all ye gods.

 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
because of thy judgments, O LORD.

 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth thou art exalted
far above all gods.

 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil he preserveth the souls of his
saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
heart.

 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness.



 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
things his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.

 The LORD hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he
openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
Israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth make a loud
noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of
a psalm.

 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
LORD, the King.

 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
that dwell therein.

 Let the floods clap their hands let the hills be joyful together

 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth with
righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.



 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble he sitteth between the
cherubims; let the earth be moved.

 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.

 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he
is holy.

 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his
testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God thou wast a God that
forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.

 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
LORD our God is holy.



 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

 Serve the LORD with gladness come before his presence with
singing.

 Know ye that the LORD he is God it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations.



 I will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee, O LORD, will I
sing.

 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes I hate the work of
them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

 A froward heart shall depart from me I will not know a wicked
person.

 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off him
that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.

 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.

 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that
telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut
off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.



 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
incline thine ear unto me in the day when I call answer me speedily.

 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as
an hearth.

 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
to eat my bread.

 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
skin.

 I am like a pelican of the wilderness I am like an owl of the
desert.

 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
against me are sworn against me.

 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
weeping.

 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast
lifted me up, and cast me down.

 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
like grass.

 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
unto all generations.

 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion for the time to
favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
dust thereof.

 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
kings of the earth thy glory.

 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
glory.

 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
their prayer.

 This shall be written for the generation to come and the
people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
appointed to death;

 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
Jerusalem;

 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
serve the LORD.

 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days thy
years are throughout all generations.

 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.

 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure yea, all of them
shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and
they shall be changed

 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
shall be established before thee.



 Bless the LORD, O my soul and all that is within me, bless his
holy name.

 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits

 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases;

 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies;

 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is
renewed like the eagle's.

 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
oppressed.

 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
Israel.

 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
in mercy.

 He will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for
ever.

 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities.

 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
mercy toward them that fear him.

 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us.

 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
that fear him.

 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

 As for man, his days are as grass as a flower of the field, so
he flourisheth.

 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
thereof shall know it no more.

 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
children;

 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
commandments to do them.

 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
kingdom ruleth over all.

 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
do his pleasure.

 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion
bless the LORD, O my soul.



 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain

 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh
the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind

 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire

 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
removed for ever.

 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters
stood above the mountains.

 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
away.

 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
the place which thou hast founded for them.

 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
turn not again to cover the earth.

 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
hills.

 They give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses
quench their thirst.

 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
which sing among the branches.

 He watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied
with the fruit of thy works.

 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
which he hath planted;

 Where the birds make their nests as for the stork, the fir
trees are her house.

 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
for the conies.

 He appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going
down.

 Thou makest darkness, and it is night wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth.

 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
God.

 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
down in their dens.

 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
evening.

 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
them all the earth is full of thy riches.

 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts.

 There go the ships there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
made to play therein.

 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat
in due season.

 That thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand,
they are filled with good.

 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled thou takest away their
breath, they die, and return to their dust.

 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created and thou
renewest the face of the earth.

 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever the LORD shall
rejoice in his works.

 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth he toucheth the
hills, and they smoke.

 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live I will sing praise
to my God while I have my being.

 My meditation of him shall be sweet I will be glad in the
LORD.

 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.



 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name make known his
deeds among the people.

 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous
works.

 Glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the LORD.

 Seek the LORD, and his strength seek his face evermore.

 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
and the judgments of his mouth;

 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
chosen.

 He is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earth.

 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations.

 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
an everlasting covenant

 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
your inheritance

 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
strangers in it.

 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
another people;

 He suffered no man to do them wrong yea, he reproved kings for
their sakes;

 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the
whole staff of bread.

 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
servant

 Whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron

 Until the time that his word came the word of the LORD tried
him.

 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
let him go free.

 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance

 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
wisdom.

 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
Ham.

 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
than their enemies.

 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
his servants.

 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
Ham.

 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
against his word.

 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
their kings.

 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
their coasts.

 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
trees of their coasts.

 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
without number,

 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
fruit of their ground.

 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
their strength.

 He brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was
not one feeble person among their tribes.

 Egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell
upon them.

 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
night.

 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
with the bread of heaven.

 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
dry places like a river.

 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
gladness

 And gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the
labour of the people;

 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise
ye the LORD.



 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good
for his mercy endureth for ever.

 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
all his praise?

 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
righteousness at all times.

 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people O visit me with thy salvation;

 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.

 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
have done wickedly.

 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at
the Red sea.

 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
make his mighty power to be known.

 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up so he led them
through the depths, as through the wilderness.

 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

 And the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them
left.

 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel

 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
the desert.

 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
soul.

 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
LORD.

 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
company of Abiram.

 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
the wicked.

 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass.

 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
Egypt;

 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
Red sea.

 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
should destroy them.

 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
word

 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
of the LORD.

 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them
in the wilderness

 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
them in the lands.

 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
sacrifices of the dead.

 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the
plague brake in upon them.

 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment and so the
plague was stayed.

 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
generations for evermore.

 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes

 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips.

 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
commanded them

 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

 And they served their idols which were a snare unto them.

 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils,

 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan and
the land was polluted with blood.

 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
with their own inventions.

 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them.

 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
subjection under their hand.

 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
cry

 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
to the multitude of his mercies.

 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives.

 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
everlasting and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.



 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever.

 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy;

 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
west, from the north, and from the south.

 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
city to dwell in.

 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered
them out of their distresses.

 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a
city of habitation.

 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!

 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness.

 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
in affliction and iron;

 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
the counsel of the most High

 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
down, and there was none to help.

 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
them out of their distresses.

 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
brake their bands in sunder.

 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!

 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
in sunder.

 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
iniquities, are afflicted.

 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
unto the gates of death.

 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
them out of their distresses.

 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
their destructions.

 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!

 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
declare his works with rejoicing.

 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
great waters;

 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
up the waves thereof.

 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths
their soul is melted because of trouble.

 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
at their wit's end.

 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
them out of their distresses.

 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
still.

 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
unto their desired haven.

 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!

 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
praise him in the assembly of the elders.

 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
dry ground;

 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein.

 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
into watersprings.

 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
a city for habitation;

 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits
of increase.

 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
affliction, and sorrow.

 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness, where there is no way.

 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
families like a flock.

 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth.

 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.



 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
my glory.

 Awake, psaltery and harp I myself will awake early.

 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people and I will sing
praises unto thee among the nations.

 For thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds.

 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens and thy glory above
all the earth;

 That thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand, and
answer me.

 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
Philistia will I triumph.

 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom?

 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
O God, go forth with our hosts?

 Give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man.

 Through God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall
tread down our enemies.



 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
against me without a cause.

 For my love they are my adversaries but I give myself unto
prayer.

 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

 Set thou a wicked man over him and let Satan stand at his right
hand.

 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned and let his
prayer become sin.

 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg let them
seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
strangers spoil his labour.

 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there
be any to favour his fatherless children.

 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
let their name be blotted out.

 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
the memory of them from the earth.

 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him as he delighted
not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so
let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
of them that speak evil against my soul.

 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake
because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth I am tossed up and
down as the locust.

 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
fatness.

 I became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me
they shaked their heads.

 Help me, O LORD my God O save me according to thy mercy

 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
done it.

 Let them curse, but bless thou when they arise, let them be
ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
praise him among the multitude.

 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
from those that condemn his soul.



 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool.

 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion rule
thou in the midst of thine enemies.

 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew
of thy youth.

 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedek.

 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
of his wrath.

 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with
the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.

 He shall drink of the brook in the way therefore shall he lift
up the head.



 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.

 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
have pleasure therein.

 His work is honourable and glorious and his righteousness
endureth for ever.

 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered the LORD is
gracious and full of compassion.

 He hath given meat unto them that fear him he will ever be
mindful of his covenant.

 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
give them the heritage of the heathen.

 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
commandments are sure.

 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
uprightness.

 He sent redemption unto his people he hath commanded his
covenant for ever holy and reverend is his name.

 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom a good
understanding have all they that do his commandments his praise
endureth for ever.



 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

 His seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of the
upright shall be blessed.

 Wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness
endureth for ever.

 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness he is
gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth he will guide his
affairs with discretion.

 Surely he shall not be moved for ever the righteous shall be in
everlasting remembrance.

 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed,
trusting in the LORD.

 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
his desire upon his enemies.

 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.

 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
his teeth, and melt away the desire of the wicked shall perish.



 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
the name of the LORD.

 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore.

 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
LORD's name is to be praised.

 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
heavens.

 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
and in the earth!

 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
out of the dunghill;

 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
people.

 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.



 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people
of strange language;

 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

 The sea saw it, and fled Jordan was driven back.

 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
lambs.

 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back?

 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
like lambs?

 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
presence of the God of Jacob;

 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
fountain of waters.



 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory,
for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

 But our God is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath
pleased.

 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

 They have mouths, but they speak not eyes have they, but they
see not

 They have ears, but they hear not noses have they, but they
smell not

 They have hands, but they handle not feet have they, but they
walk not neither speak they through their throat.

 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
trusteth in them.

 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD he is their help and their
shield.

 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD he is their help and their
shield.

 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD he is their help and
their shield.

 The LORD hath been mindful of us he will bless us; he will
bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
children.

 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's but the earth
hath he given to the children of men.

 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
silence.

 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore.

Praise the LORD.



 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
supplications.

 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live.

 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
hold upon me I found trouble and sorrow.

 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,
deliver my soul.

 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

 The LORD preserveth the simple I was brought low, and he helped
me.

 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
bountifully with thee.

 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling.

 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

 I believed, therefore have I spoken I was greatly afflicted

 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
me?

 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
LORD.

 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people.

 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
of thine handmaid thou hast loosed my bonds.

 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
call upon the name of the LORD.

 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people.

 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.



 O praise the LORD, all ye nations praise him, all ye people.

 For his merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of
the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.



 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good because his mercy
endureth for ever.

 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
ever.

 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for
ever.

 I called upon the LORD in distress the LORD answered me, and
set me in a large place.

 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear what can man do unto
me?

 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall
I see my desire upon them that hate me.

 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.

 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
princes.

 All nations compassed me about but in the name of the LORD
will I destroy them.

 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about but in
the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

 They compassed me about like bees they are quenched as the
fire of thorns for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall but the LORD
helped me.

 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
the righteous the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

 The right hand of the LORD is exalted the right hand of the
LORD doeth valiantly.

 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

 The LORD hath chastened me sore but he hath not given me over
unto death.

 Open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them, and
I will praise the LORD

 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

 I will praise thee for thou hast heard me, and art become my
salvation.

 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
of the corner.

 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
be glad in it.

 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD O LORD, I beseech thee, send
now prosperity.

 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD we have
blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light bind the sacrifice
with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee thou art my God, I
will exalt thee.

 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever.



 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
LORD.

 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
with the whole heart.

 They also do no iniquity they walk in his ways.

 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
commandments.

 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
learned thy righteous judgments.

 I will keep thy statutes O forsake me not utterly.

 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
thereto according to thy word.

 With my whole heart have I sought thee O let me not wander
from thy commandments.

 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
thee.

 Blessed art thou, O LORD teach me thy statutes.

 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
all riches.

 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
ways.

 I will delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget thy
word.

 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
thy word.

 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
thy law.

 I am a stranger in the earth hide not thy commandments from
me.

 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
judgments at all times.

 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
thy commandments.

 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
testimonies.

 Princes also did sit and speak against me but thy servant did
meditate in thy statutes.

 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth.

 My soul cleaveth unto the dust quicken thou me according to
thy word.

 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me teach me thy
statutes.

 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts so shall I talk
of thy wondrous works.

 My soul melteth for heaviness strengthen thou me according
unto thy word.

 Remove from me the way of lying and grant me thy law
graciously.

 I have chosen the way of truth thy judgments have I laid
before me.

 I have stuck unto thy testimonies O LORD, put me not to shame.

 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge
my heart.

 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
unto the end.

 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
observe it with my whole heart.

 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
delight.

 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.

 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
in thy way.

 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.

 Turn away my reproach which I fear for thy judgments are good.

 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts quicken me in thy
righteousness.

 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
according to thy word.

 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me
for I trust in thy word.

 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
have hoped in thy judgments.

 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

 And I will walk at liberty for I seek thy precepts.

 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not
be ashamed.

 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
loved.

 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
me to hope.

 This is my comfort in my affliction for thy word hath
quickened me.

 The proud have had me greatly in derision yet have I not
declined from thy law.

 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
myself.

 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
forsake thy law.

 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept
thy law.

 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

 Thou art my portion, O LORD I have said that I would keep thy
words.

 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart be merciful unto me
according to thy word.

 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

 The bands of the wicked have robbed me but I have not
forgotten thy law.

 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
righteous judgments.

 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
keep thy precepts.

 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes.

 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
thy word.

 Teach me good judgment and knowledge for I have believed thy
commandments.

 Before I was afflicted I went astray but now have I kept thy
word.

 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

 The proud have forged a lie against me but I will keep thy
precepts with my whole heart.

 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
learn thy statutes.

 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
and silver.

 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me give me understanding,
that I may learn thy commandments.

 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
have hoped in thy word.

 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
faithfulness hast afflicted me.

 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
according to thy word unto thy servant.

 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live for thy
law is my delight.

 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
without a cause but I will meditate in thy precepts.

 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
known thy testimonies.

 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

 My soul fainteth for thy salvation but I hope in thy word.

 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?

 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget
thy statutes.

 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me?

 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.

 All thy commandments are faithful they persecute me
wrongfully; help thou me.

 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
precepts.

 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
testimony of thy mouth.

 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou hast established
the earth, and it abideth.

 They continue this day according to thine ordinances for all
are thy servants.

 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
perished in mine affliction.

 I will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast
quickened me.

 I am thine, save me for I have sought thy precepts.

 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me but I will
consider thy testimonies.

 I have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandment is
exceeding broad.

 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
enemies for they are ever with me.

 I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy
testimonies are my meditation.

 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
precepts.

 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
keep thy word.

 I have not departed from thy judgments for thou hast taught
me.

 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
to my mouth!

 Through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate
every false way.

 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
righteous judgments.

 I am afflicted very much quicken me, O LORD, according unto
thy word.

 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

 My soul is continually in my hand yet do I not forget thy
law.

 The wicked have laid a snare for me yet I erred not from thy
precepts.

 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever for they
are the rejoicing of my heart.

 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
unto the end.

 I hate vain thoughts but thy law do I love.

 Thou art my hiding place and my shield I hope in thy word.

 Depart from me, ye evildoers for I will keep the commandments
of my God.

 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live and let me
not be ashamed of my hope.

 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe and I will have respect
unto thy statutes continually.

 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes
for their deceit is falsehood.

 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross
therefore I love thy testimonies.

 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
judgments.

 I have done judgment and justice leave me not to mine
oppressors.

 Be surety for thy servant for good let not the proud oppress
me.

 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
righteousness.

 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
thy statutes.

 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
testimonies.

 It is time for thee, LORD, to work for they have made void
thy law.

 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
gold.

 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
be right; and I hate every false way.

 Thy testimonies are wonderful therefore doth my soul keep
them.

 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
understanding unto the simple.

 I opened my mouth, and panted for I longed for thy
commandments.

 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
do unto those that love thy name.

 Order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have
dominion over me.

 Deliver me from the oppression of man so will I keep thy
precepts.

 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
statutes.

 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
law.

 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
very faithful.

 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
thy words.

 Thy word is very pure therefore thy servant loveth it.

 I am small and despised yet do not I forget thy precepts.

 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
is the truth.

 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me yet thy
commandments are my delights.

 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting give me
understanding, and I shall live.

 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD I will keep thy
statutes.

 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried I hoped in
thy word.

 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
thy word.

 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness O LORD,
quicken me according to thy judgment.

 They draw nigh that follow after mischief they are far from
thy law.

 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
founded them for ever.

 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me for I do not forget
thy law.

 Plead my cause, and deliver me quicken me according to thy
word.

 Salvation is far from the wicked for they seek not thy
statutes.

 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD quicken me according to
thy judgments.

 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
from thy testimonies.

 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
not thy word.

 Consider how I love thy precepts quicken me, O LORD,
according to thy lovingkindness.

 Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy
righteous judgments endureth for ever.

 Princes have persecuted me without a cause but my heart
standeth in awe of thy word.

 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

 I hate and abhor lying but thy law do I love.

 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
judgments.

 Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall
offend them.

 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
commandments.

 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
exceedingly.

 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies for all my ways
are before thee.

 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD give me
understanding according to thy word.

 Let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to
thy word.

 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
statutes.

 My tongue shall speak of thy word for all thy commandments
are righteousness.

 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
delight.

 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
judgments help me.

 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
do not forget thy commandments.



 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
tongue.

 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,
thou false tongue?

 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
of Kedar!

 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

 I am for peace but when I speak, they are for war.



 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
help.

 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee
will not slumber.

 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

 The LORD is thy keeper the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
hand.

 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve
thy soul.

 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
this time forth, and even for evermore.



 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
the LORD.

 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together

 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house
of David.

 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem they shall prosper that love
thee.

 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be
within thee.

 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.



 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
heavens.

 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us for we are
exceedingly filled with contempt.

 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.



 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel
say;

 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
up against us

 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
kindled against us

 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
soul

 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
teeth.

 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers
the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.



 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot
be removed, but abideth for ever.

 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
about his people from henceforth even for ever.

 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.

 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
upright in their hearts.

 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be
upon Israel.



 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
them that dream.

 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
singing then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great
things for them.

 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.



 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build
it except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.

 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD and the fruit of the
womb is his reward.

 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
the youth.

 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall
not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.



 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his
ways.

 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands happy shalt thou
be, and it shall be well with thee.

 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
house thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
LORD.

 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion and thou shalt see the
good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
Israel.



 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now
say

 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth yet they have
not prevailed against me.

 The plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows.

 The LORD is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the
wicked.

 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
afore it groweth up

 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
sheaves his bosom.

 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
upon you we bless you in the name of the LORD.



 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

 Lord, hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of
my supplications.

 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand?

 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
hope.

 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
morning I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

 Let Israel hope in the LORD for with the LORD there is mercy,
and with him is plenteous redemption.

 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.



 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty neither do I
exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child.

 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.



 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions

 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
Jacob;

 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
up into my bed;

 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,

 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
mighty God of Jacob.

 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah we found it in the fields of the
wood.

 We will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his
footstool.

 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
saints shout for joy.

 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
anointed.

 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for
evermore.

 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
habitation.

 This is my rest for ever here will I dwell; for I have desired
it.

 I will abundantly bless her provision I will satisfy her poor
with bread.

 I will also clothe her priests with salvation and her saints
shall shout aloud for joy.

 There will I make the horn of David to bud I have ordained a
lamp for mine anointed.

 His enemies will I clothe with shame but upon himself shall
his crown flourish.



 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity!

 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
upon the beard, even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of
his garments;

 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
mountains of Zion for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even
life for evermore.



 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by
night stand in the house of the LORD.

 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.



 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him,
O ye servants of the LORD.

 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
house of our God.

 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good sing praises unto his
name; for it is pleasant.

 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his
peculiar treasure.

 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
all gods.

 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he
maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his
treasuries.

 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
kingdoms of Canaan

 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
his people.

 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
throughout all generations.

 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
concerning his servants.

 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's
hands.

 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
see not;

 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
in their mouths.

 They that make them are like unto them so is every one that
trusteth in them.

 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel bless the LORD, O house of
Aaron

 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi ye that fear the LORD, bless
the LORD.

 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.

Praise ye the LORD.



 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever.

 O give thanks unto the God of gods for his mercy endureth for
ever.

 O give thanks to the Lord of lords for his mercy endureth for
ever.

 To him who alone doeth great wonders for his mercy endureth for
ever.

 To him that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth
for ever.

 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters for his
mercy endureth for ever.

 To him that made great lights for his mercy endureth for ever

 The sun to rule by day for his mercy endureth for ever

 The moon and stars to rule by night for his mercy endureth for
ever.

 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn for his mercy
endureth for ever

 And brought out Israel from among them for his mercy endureth
for ever

 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm for his mercy
endureth for ever.

 To him which divided the Red sea into parts for his mercy
endureth for ever

 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy
endureth for ever

 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea for his
mercy endureth for ever.

 To him which led his people through the wilderness for his
mercy endureth for ever.

 To him which smote great kings for his mercy endureth for
ever

 And slew famous kings for his mercy endureth for ever

 Sihon king of the Amorites for his mercy endureth for ever

 And Og the king of Bashan for his mercy endureth for ever

 And gave their land for an heritage for his mercy endureth for
ever

 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant for his mercy
endureth for ever.

 Who remembered us in our low estate for his mercy endureth for
ever

 And hath redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth
for ever.

 Who giveth food to all flesh for his mercy endureth for ever.

 O give thanks unto the God of heaven for his mercy endureth
for ever.



 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when
we remembered Zion.

 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us
one of the songs of Zion.

 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning.

 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem;
who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.

 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the stones.



 I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will I
sing praise unto thee.

 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word
above all thy name.

 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
me with strength in my soul.

 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they
hear the words of thy mouth.

 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD for great is the
glory of the LORD.

 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly but
the proud he knoweth afar off.

 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me thou
shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and
thy right hand shall save me.

 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy, O
LORD, endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands.



 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
understandest my thought afar off.

 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
with all my ways.

 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
knowest it altogether.

 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
me.

 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
attain unto it.

 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from
thy presence?

 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there if I make my bed in
hell, behold, thou art there.

 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea;

 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
hold me.

 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
shall be light about me.

 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

 For thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my
mother's womb.

 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were
fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is
the sum of them!

 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand
when I awake, I am still with thee.

 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God depart from me
therefore, ye bloody men.

 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
thy name in vain.

 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
grieved with those that rise up against thee?

 I hate them with perfect hatred I count them mine enemies.

 Search me, O God, and know my heart try me, and know my
thoughts

 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
way everlasting.



 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man preserve me from the
violent man;

 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
gathered together for war.

 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison
is under their lips. Selah.

 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from
the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a
net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God hear the voice of my
supplications, O LORD.

 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered
my head in the day of battle.

 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked further not his
wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief
of their own lips cover them.

 Let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the
fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall
hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
and the right of the poor.

 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the
upright shall dwell in thy presence.



 Lord, I cry unto thee make haste unto me; give ear unto my
voice, when I cry unto thee.

 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works
with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties.

 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness and let him
reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my
head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.

 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
hear my words; for they are sweet.

 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord in thee is my
trust; leave not my soul destitute.

 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
gins of the workers of iniquity.

 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
escape.



 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD
did I make my supplication.

 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
trouble.

 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
path.

In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
would know me refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

 I cried unto thee, O LORD I said, Thou art my refuge and my
portion in the land of the living.

 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low deliver me from
my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name the
righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with
me.



 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications in thy
faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

 And enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.

 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those
that have been long dead.

 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me
is desolate.

 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse
on the work of thy hands.

 I stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after
thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

 Hear me speedily, O LORD my spirit faileth hide not thy face
from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee
do I trust cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift
up my soul unto thee.

 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies I flee unto thee to hide
me.

 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God thy spirit is
good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake for thy righteousness'
sake bring my soul out of trouble.

 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
that afflict my soul for I am thy servant.



 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war,
and my fingers to fight

 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.

 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son
of man, that thou makest account of him!

 Man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth
away.

 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.

 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them shoot out thine arrows,
and destroy them.

 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
waters, from the hand of strange children;

 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
hand of falsehood.

 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God upon a psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings who delivereth David
his servant from the hurtful sword.

 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose
mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
falsehood

 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude
of a palace

 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store
that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
streets

 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our
streets.

 Happy is that people, that is in such a case yea, happy is
that people, whose God is the LORD.



 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for
ever and ever.

 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever
and ever.

 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness
is unsearchable.

 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
declare thy mighty acts.

 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
wondrous works.

 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and I
will declare thy greatness.

 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
and shall sing of thy righteousness.

 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and
of great mercy.

 The LORD is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his
works.

 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
bless thee.

 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
power;

 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
glorious majesty of his kingdom.

 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
endureth throughout all generations.

 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that
be bowed down.

 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat
in due season.

 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
living thing.

 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
works.

 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
call upon him in truth.

 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him he also will
hear their cry, and will save them.

 The LORD preserveth all them that love him but all the wicked
will he destroy.

 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD and let all flesh
bless his holy name for ever and ever.



 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

 While I live will I praise the LORD I will sing praises unto my
God while I have any being.

 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
there is no help.

 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
day his thoughts perish.

 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
is in the LORD his God

 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is
which keepeth truth for ever

 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to
the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners

 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind the LORD raiseth them
that are bowed down the LORD loveth the righteous

 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
and widow but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
generations. Praise ye the LORD.



 Praise ye the LORD for it is good to sing praises unto our God;
for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem he gathereth together the
outcasts of Israel.

 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their
names.

 Great is our Lord, and of great power his understanding is
infinite.

 The LORD lifteth up the meek he casteth the wicked down to the
ground.

 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp
unto our God

 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the
earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
cry.

 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse he taketh not
pleasure in the legs of a man.

 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
hope in his mercy.

 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed
thy children within thee.

 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
finest of the wheat.

 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth his word runneth
very swiftly.

 He giveth snow like wool he scattereth the hoarfrost like
ashes.

 He casteth forth his ice like morsels who can stand before his
cold?

 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them he causeth his wind
to blow, and the waters flow.

 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
unto Israel.

 He hath not dealt so with any nation and as for his judgments,
they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.



 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens praise
him in the heights.

 Praise ye him, all his angels praise ye him, all his hosts.

 Praise ye him, sun and moon praise him, all ye stars of light.

 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
the heavens.

 Let them praise the name of the LORD for he commanded, and they
were created.

 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever he hath made a
decree which shall not pass.

 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps

 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
word

 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars

 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl

 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
the earth

 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children

 Let them praise the name of the LORD for his name alone is
excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise
ye the LORD.



 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
praise in the congregation of saints.

 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of
Zion be joyful in their King.

 Let them praise his name in the dance let them sing praises
unto him with the timbrel and harp.

 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the
meek with salvation.

 Let the saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon
their beds.

 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
sword in their hand;

 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
people;

 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
of iron;

 To execute upon them the judgment written this honour have all
his saints. Praise ye the LORD.



 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary praise him in
the firmament of his power.

 Praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his
excellent greatness.

 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the
psaltery and harp.

 Praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed
instruments and organs.

 Praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high
sounding cymbals.

 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.




The Proverbs


 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;  To
know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and
equity;  To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge
and discretion.

 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels  To understand a
proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark
sayings.

 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge but fools
despise wisdom and instruction.

 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the
law of thy mother  For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy
head, and chains about thy neck.

 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause  Let us swallow them up
alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit
 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
with spoil  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse
 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from
their path  For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed
blood.

 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
their own lives.

 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh
away the life of the owners thereof.

 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets
 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
the gates in the city she uttereth her words, saying,  How long,
ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in
their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?   Turn you at my
reproof behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known
my words unto you.

 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
hand, and no man regarded;  But ye have set at nought all my
counsel, and would none of my reproof  I also will laugh at your
calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;  When your fear
cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when
distress and anguish cometh upon you.

 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall
seek me early, but they shall not find me  For that they hated
knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD  They would
none of my counsel they despised all my reproof.

 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
filled with their own devices.

 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
quiet from fear of evil.

 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments
with thee;  So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply
thine heart to understanding;  Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
and liftest up thy voice for understanding;  If thou seekest her as
silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;  Then shalt
thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.

 For the LORD giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
understanding.

 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to
them that walk uprightly.

 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his
saints.

 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
equity; yea, every good path.

 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul;  Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding
shall keep thee  To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
from the man that speaketh froward things;  Who leave the paths of
uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;  Who rejoice to do
evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;  Whose ways
are crooked, and they froward in their paths  To deliver thee
from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with
her words;  Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth
the covenant of her God.

 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the
paths of life.

 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
of the righteous.

 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
remain in it.

 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
commandments  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall
they add to thee.

 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck;
write them upon the table of thine heart  So shalt thou find
favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine
own understanding.

 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

 Be not wise in thine own eyes fear the LORD, and depart from
evil.

 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of
all thine increase  So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and
thy presses shall burst out with new wine.

 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary
of his correction  For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even
as a father the son in whom he delighteth.

 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
understanding.

 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

 She is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst
desire are not to be compared unto her.

 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches
and honour.

 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy
is every one that retaineth her.

 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath
he established the heavens.

 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
down the dew.

 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom
and discretion  So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to
thy neck.

 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
stumble.

 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid yea, thou shalt
lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
wicked, when it cometh.

 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
from being taken.

 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thine hand to do it.

 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I
will give; when thou hast it by thee.

 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
securely by thee.

 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
harm.

 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

 For the froward is abomination to the LORD but his secret is
with the righteous.

 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked but he
blesseth the habitation of the just.

 Surely he scorneth the scorners but he giveth grace unto the
lowly.

 The wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of
fools.

 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know
understanding.

 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of
my mother.

 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
words keep my commandments, and live.

 Get wisdom, get understanding forget it not; neither decline from
the words of my mouth.

 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee love her, and she
shall keep thee.

 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom and with all
thy getting get understanding.

 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to
honour, when thou dost embrace her.

 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of
glory shall she deliver to thee.

 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life
shall be many.

 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
paths.

 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go keep her; for she
is thy life.

 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of
evil men.

 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
violence.

 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day.

 The way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they
stumble.

 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
thine heart.

 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
their flesh.

 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues
of life.

 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
from thee.

 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight
before thee.

 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.

 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from
evil.

 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
understanding  That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy
lips may keep knowledge.

 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
mouth is smoother than oil  But her end is bitter as wormwood,
sharp as a two-edged sword.

 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
moveable, that thou canst not know them.

 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
words of my mouth.

 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
house  Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
the cruel  Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy
labours be in the house of a stranger;  And thou mourn at the
last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,  And say, How have
I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;  And have not
obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that
instructed me!   I was almost in all evil in the midst of the
congregation and assembly.

 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of
thine own well.

 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
the streets.

 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

 Let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy
youth.

 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts
satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and
embrace the bosom of a stranger?   For the ways of man are before
the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.

 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be
holden with the cords of his sins.

 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
folly he shall go astray.

 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken
thy hand with a stranger,  Thou art snared with the words of thy
mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.

 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into
the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
bird from the hand of the fowler.

 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise 
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  Provideth her meat in
the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.

 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep?   Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to sleep  So shall thy poverty come as one
that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth
with his fingers;  Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth
mischief continually; he soweth discord.

 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be
broken without remedy.

 These six things doth the LORD hate yea, seven are an
abomination unto him  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands
that shed innocent blood,  An heart that deviseth wicked
imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,  A false
witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of
thy mother  Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them
about thy neck.

 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall
keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs
of instruction are the way of life  To keep thee from the evil
woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
thee with her eyelids.

 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
bread and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?   So
he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall
not be innocent.

 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when
he is hungry;  But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he
shall give all the substance of his house.

 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding
he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be
wiped away.

 For jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in
the day of vengeance.

 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
though thou givest many gifts.

 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine
eye.

 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
heart.

 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy
kinswoman  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from
the stranger which flattereth with her words.

 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a
young man void of understanding,  Passing through the street near
her corner; and he went the way to her house,  In the twilight, in
the evening, in the black and dark night  And, behold, there met
him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.

 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house 
Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every
corner.)   So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent
face said unto him,  I have peace offerings with me; this day have
I payed my vows.

 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face,
and I have found thee.

 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, with fine linen of Egypt.

 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning let us
solace ourselves with loves.

 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey 
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day
appointed.

 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
flattering of her lips she forced him.

 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter,
or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  Till a dart strike
through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not
that it is for his life.

 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the
words of my mouth.

 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
paths.

 For she hath cast down many wounded yea, many strong men have
been slain by her.

 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
death.

 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of
the paths.

 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming
in at the doors.

 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

 O ye simple, understand wisdom and, ye fools, be ye of an
understanding heart.

 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my
lips shall be right things.

 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination
to my lips.

 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing
froward or perverse in them.

 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them
that find knowledge.

 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than
choice gold.

 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be
desired are not to be compared to it.

 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
inventions.

 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil pride, and arrogancy, and
the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom I am understanding; I have
strength.

 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find
me.

 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
righteousness.

 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue
than choice silver.

 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of
judgment  That I may cause those that love me to inherit
substance; and I will fill their treasures.

 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
works of old.

 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
earth was.

 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were
no fountains abounding with water.

 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought
forth  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
nor the highest part of the dust of the world.

 When he prepared the heavens, I was there when he set a compass
upon the face of the depth  When he established the clouds above
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep  When he gave to
the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment
when he appointed the foundations of the earth  Then I was by
him, as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight,
rejoicing always before him;  Rejoicing in the habitable part of
his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.

 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children for blessed are
they that keep my ways.

 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,
waiting at the posts of my doors.

 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the
LORD.

 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they
that hate me love death.

 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
pillars  She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
she hath also furnished her table.

 She hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest
places of the city,  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither as
for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  Come, eat of
my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that
rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man, and
he will love thee.

 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser teach a
just man, and he will increase in learning.

 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the
knowledge of the holy is understanding.

 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life
shall be increased.

 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou
scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

 A foolish woman is clamorous she is simple, and knoweth nothing.

 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high
places of the city,  To call passengers who go right on their
ways  Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither and as for him
that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  Stolen waters are
sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.

 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests
are in the depths of hell.

 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father but a
foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness
delivereth from death.

 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but
he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of
the diligent maketh rich.

 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth
in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

 Blessings are upon the head of the just but violence covereth
the mouth of the wicked.

 The memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked
shall rot.

 The wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool
shall fall.

 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth
his ways shall be known.

 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool
shall fall.

 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence
covereth the mouth of the wicked.

 Hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sins.

 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but
a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.

 Wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near
destruction.

 The rich man's wealth is his strong city the destruction of the
poor is their poverty.

 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the
wicked to sin.

 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he that
refuseth reproof erreth.

 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
slander, is a fool.

 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin but he that
refraineth his lips is wise.

 The tongue of the just is as choice silver the heart of the
wicked is little worth.

 The lips of the righteous feed many but fools die for want of
wisdom.

 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
sorrow with it.

 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief but a man of
understanding hath wisdom.

 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him but the desire
of the righteous shall be granted.

 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more but the
righteous is an everlasting foundation.

 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
sluggard to them that send him.

 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days but the years of the
wicked shall be shortened.

 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the expectation
of the wicked shall perish.

 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright but destruction
shall be to the workers of iniquity.

 The righteous shall never be removed but the wicked shall not
inhabit the earth.

 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom but the froward
tongue shall be cut out.

 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth
of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

 A false balance is abomination to the LORD but a just weight is
his delight.

 When pride cometh, then cometh shame but with the lowly is
wisdom.

 The integrity of the upright shall guide them but the
perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

 Riches profit not in the day of wrath but righteousness
delivereth from death.

 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the
wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them but
transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish and the
hope of unjust men perisheth.

 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh
in his stead.

 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour but through
knowledge shall the just be delivered.

 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth and
when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it is
overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour but a man of
understanding holdeth his peace.

 A talebearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful
spirit concealeth the matter.

 Where no counsel is, the people fall but in the multitude of
counsellors there is safety.

 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it and he that
hateth suretiship is sure.

 A gracious woman retaineth honour and strong men retain riches.

 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that is
cruel troubleth his own flesh.

 The wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that soweth
righteousness shall be a sure reward.

 As righteousness tendeth to life so he that pursueth evil
pursueth it to his own death.

 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD
but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished
but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which
is without discretion.

 The desire of the righteous is only good but the expectation of
the wicked is wrath.

 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that
withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

 The liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall
be watered also himself.

 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him but
blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour but he that
seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
shall flourish as a branch.

 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the
fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
winneth souls is wise.

 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth much
more the wicked and the sinner.

 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hateth
reproof is brutish.

 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD but a man of wicked
devices will he condemn.

 A man shall not be established by wickedness but the root of the
righteous shall not be moved.

 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh
ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

 The thoughts of the righteous are right but the counsels of the
wicked are deceit.

 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood but the
mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

 The wicked are overthrown, and are not but the house of the
righteous shall stand.

 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom but he that is
of a perverse heart shall be despised.

 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that
honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast but the tender
mercies of the wicked are cruel.

 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread but he
that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

 The wicked desireth the net of evil men but the root of the
righteous yieldeth fruit.

 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips but the
just shall come out of trouble.

 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth
and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.

 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that
hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

 A fool's wrath is presently known but a prudent man covereth
shame.

 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness but a false
witness deceit.

 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword but the
tongue of the wise is health.

 The lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying
tongue is but for a moment.

 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil but to the
counsellors of peace is joy.

 There shall no evil happen to the just but the wicked shall be
filled with mischief.

 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD but they that deal truly
are his delight.

 A prudent man concealeth knowledge but the heart of fools
proclaimeth foolishness.

 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall
be under tribute.

 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word
maketh it glad.

 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour but the way
of the wicked seduceth them.

 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting but
the substance of a diligent man is precious.

 In the way of righteousness is life and in the pathway thereof
there is no death.

 A wise son heareth his father's instruction but a scorner
heareth not rebuke.

 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of
the transgressors shall eat violence.

 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth
wide his lips shall have destruction.

 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing but the soul
of the diligent shall be made fat.

 A righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome, and
cometh to shame.

 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but
wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing there is
that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

 The ransom of a man's life are his riches but the poor heareth
not rebuke.

 The light of the righteous rejoiceth but the lamp of the wicked
shall be put out.

 Only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is
wisdom.

 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,
Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine
oaths  But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven;
for it is God's throne  Nor by the earth; for it is his
footstool neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make
one hair white or black.

 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay for whatsoever
is more than these cometh of evil.

 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth  But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
other also.

 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak also.

 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not thou away.

 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you, and persecute you;  That ye may be the children of your
Father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil
and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not
even the publicans the same?   And if ye salute your brethren
only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect.

 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them
otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have their reward.

 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth  That thine alms may be in secret and thy Father
which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of
the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They
have their reward.

 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do for
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

 Be not ye therefore like unto them for your Father knoweth what
things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

 After this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

 Give us this day our daily bread.

 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil For
thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
countenance for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto
men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
face;  That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
which is in secret and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
reward thee openly.

 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal  But
lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal 
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

 The light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be
single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
darkness.

If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness!   No man can serve two masters for either he will hate
the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye
shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than
raiment?   Behold the fowls of the air for they sow not, neither
do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
them. Are ye not much better than they?   Which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit unto his stature?   And why take ye
thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;
they toil not, neither do they spin  And yet I say unto you, That
even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day
is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe
you, O ye of little faith?   Therefore take no thought, saying,
What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we
be clothed?   (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek)
for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
things.

 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
all these things shall be added unto you.

 Take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof.

 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged and with what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?   Or how wilt
thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;
and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?   Thou hypocrite, first
cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see
clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn
again and rend you.

 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you  For every one that asketh
receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it
shall be opened.

 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he
give him a stone?   Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a
serpent?   If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask him?   Therefore all things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them
for this is the law and the prophets.

 Enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate, and broad
is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
thereat  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?   Even so every good tree bringeth
forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit.

 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which
is in heaven.

 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in
thy name done many wonderful works?   And then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a
rock  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not for it was founded
upon a rock.

 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon
the sand  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell and great was the
fall of it.

 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
people were astonished at his doctrine  For he taught them as one
having authority, and not as the scribes.

 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
him.

 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be
thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,
shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
for a testimony unto them.

 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
centurion, beseeching him,  And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at
home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only, and my servant
shall be healed.

 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me and I
say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no,
not in Israel.

 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,
and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom
of heaven.

 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the
selfsame hour.

 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's
mother laid, and sick of a fever.

 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her and she arose,
and ministered unto them.

 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word, and
healed all that were sick  That it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities,
and bare our sicknesses.

 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
commandment to depart unto the other side.

 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first
to go and bury my father.

 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their
dead.

 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.

 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep.

 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save
us we perish.

 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a
great calm.

 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that
even the winds and the sea obey him!   And when he was come to the
other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two
possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so
that no man might pass by that way.

 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us
before the time?   And there was a good way off from them an herd
of many swine feeding.

 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer
us to go away into the herd of swine.

 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went
into the herd of swine and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran
violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.

 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,
and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the
devils.

 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus and when they
saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
city.

 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on
a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy;
Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.

 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This
man blasphemeth.

 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in
your hearts?   For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven
thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?   But that ye may know that the
Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the
sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

 And he arose, and departed to his house.

 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
which had given such power unto men.

 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him,
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,
many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his
disciples.

 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?   But when Jesus
heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick.

 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.

 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?   And Jesus said
unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom
shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.

 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is
made worse.

 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles
break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish but they put
new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now
dead but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood
twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment
 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
shall be whole.

 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the
woman was made whole from that hour.

 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels
and the people making a noise,  He said unto them, Give place for
the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by
the hand, and the maid arose.

 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him
and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They
said unto him, Yea, Lord.

 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
unto you.

 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
saying, See that no man know it.

 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all
that country.

 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
possessed with a devil.

 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake and the
multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince
of the devils.

 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
every sickness and every disease among the people.

 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having
no shepherd.

 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,
but the labourers are few;  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all
manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,
who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee,
and John his brother;  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and
Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose
surname was Thaddaeus;  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot,
who also betrayed him.

 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not
into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans
enter ye not  But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.

 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
devils freely ye have received, freely give.

 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 
Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet
staves for the workman is worthy of his meat.

 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in
it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it but if
it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye
therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

 But beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils,
and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  And ye shall be
brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony
against them and the Gentiles.

 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
speak.

 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
speaketh in you.

 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
father the child and the children shall rise up against their
parents, and cause them to be put to death.

 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that
endureth to the end shall be saved.

 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another
for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of
Israel, till the Son of man be come.

 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his
lord.

 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house
Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  
Fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered, that shall not
be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light and what ye
hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and
body in hell.

 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your Father.

 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
before my Father which is in heaven.

 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to
send peace, but a sword.

 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her
mother in law.

 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of
me.

 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
worthy of me.

 He that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his
life for my sake shall find it.

 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me.

 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in
the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones
a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto
you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their
cities.

 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
sent two of his disciples,  And said unto him, Art thou he that
should come, or do we look for another?   Jesus answered and said
unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and
see  The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor
have the gospel preached to them.

 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken with the wind?   But what went ye out for to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment?  behold, they that wear soft clothing are in
kings' houses.

 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,
and more than a prophet.

 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he
that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.

 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 
And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath
a devil.

 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a
man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
But wisdom is justified of her children.

 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
works were done, because they repented not  Woe unto thee,
Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which
were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have
repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
brought down to hell for if the mighty works, which have been done in
thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land
of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

 Even so, Father for so it seemed good in thy sight.

 All things are delivered unto me of my Father and no man
knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father,
save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.

 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.

 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and
his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and
to eat.

 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.

 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he
was an hungred, and they that were with him;  How he entered into
the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for
him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the
priests?   Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath
days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
temple.

 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue
 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that
they might accuse him.

 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day,
will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?   How much then is a
man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
sabbath days.

 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
they might destroy him.

 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence and
great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  And
charged them that they should not make him known  That it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is
well pleased I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew
judgment to the Gentiles.

 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
voice in the streets.

 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and
dumb and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake
and saw.

 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
David?   But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow
doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or
house divided against itself shall not stand  And if Satan cast
out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom
stand?   And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom
of God is come unto you.

 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil
his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil
his house.

 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth abroad.

 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall
be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall
not be forgiven unto men.

 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it
shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world
to come.

 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his
fruit.

 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth
evil things.

 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned.

 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to
it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas  For as Jonas was three
days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be
three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.

 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.

 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there and the last
state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also
unto this wicked generation.

 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
mother?  and who are my brethren?   And he stretched forth his
hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,
the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
side.

 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a
sower went forth to sow;  And when he sowed, some seeds fell by
the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up  Some fell
upon stony places, where they had not much earth and forthwith they
sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth  And when the
sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they
withered away.

 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
them  But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit,
some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
unto them in parables?   He answered and said unto them, Because
it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
but to them it is not given.

 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away
even that he hath.

 Therefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see
not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall
see, and shall not perceive  For this people's heart is waxed
gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have
closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with
their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be
converted, and I should heal them.

 But blessed are your eyes, for they see and your ears, for they
hear.

 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men
have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them;
and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth
it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was
sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.

 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  Yet hath
he not root in himself, but dureth for a while for when tribulation
or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and
bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field 
But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,
and went his way.

 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also.

 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it
tares?   He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants
said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them.

 Let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,
and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my
barn.

 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed
in his field  Which indeed is the least of all seeds but when
it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so
that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened.

 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
without a parable spake he not unto them  That it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my
mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret
from the foundation of the world.

 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house and
his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of
the tares of the field.

 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
the Son of man;  The field is the world; the good seed are the
children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked
one;  The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the
end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
shall it be in the end of this world.

 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do
iniquity;  And shall cast them into a furnace of fire there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
seeking goodly pearls  Who, when he had found one pearl of great
price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
into the sea, and gathered of every kind  Which, when it was
full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into
vessels, but cast the bad away.

 So shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come
forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  And shall cast
them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth.

 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They
say unto him, Yea, Lord.

 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and
old.

 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
parables, he departed thence.

 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence
hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?   Is not this
the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren,
James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?   And his sisters, are
they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own
house.

 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
unbelief.

 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from
the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
because they counted him as a prophet.

 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
danced before them, and pleased Herod.

 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
would ask.

 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
here John Baptist's head in a charger.

 And the king was sorry nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.

 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel
and she brought it to her mother.

 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
went and told Jesus.

 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
place apart and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him
on foot out of the cities.

 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This
is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away,
that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to
eat.

 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
fishes.

 He said, Bring them hither to me.

 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he
blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude.

 And they did all eat, and were filled and they took up of the
fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
women and children.

 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the
multitudes away.

 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come, he was there
alone.

 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves
for the wind was contrary.

 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
walking on the sea.

 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
it is I; be not afraid.

 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the water.

 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,
he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,
and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying,
Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
Gennesaret.

 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that
were diseased;  And besought him that they might only touch the
hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
Jerusalem, saying,  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition
of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
commandment of God by your tradition?   For God commanded, saying,
Honour thy father and mother and, He that curseth father or mother,
let him die the death.

 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It
is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  And
honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye
made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,  This
people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with
their lips; but their heart is far from me.

 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.

 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
understand  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;
but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?   But
he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not
planted, shall be rooted up.

 Let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
parable.

 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?   Do
not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth
into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?   But those
things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and
they defile the man.

 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies  These are the
things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not
a man.

 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon.

 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David;
my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.

 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's
bread, and to cast it to dogs.

 And she said, Truth, Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters' table.

 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made
whole from that very hour.

 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that
were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at
Jesus' feet; and he healed them  Insomuch that the multitude
wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the
lame to walk, and the blind to see and they glorified the God of
Israel.

 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat and I will not send them away fasting,
lest they faint in the way.

 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?   And
Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven,
and a few little fishes.

 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the
multitude.

 And they did all eat, and were filled and they took up of the
broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
children.

 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the
coasts of Magdala.

 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
will be fair weather for the sky is red.

 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day for the sky
is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the
sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?   A wicked and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them,
and departed.

 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
forgotten to take bread.

 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
taken no bread.

 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no
bread?   Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five
loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye
took up?   How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it
not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?   Then understood they how
that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the
doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist some,
Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?   And Simon
Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God.

 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
Barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven.

 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.

 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
he was Jesus the Christ.

 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how
that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders
and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the
third day.

 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
from thee, Lord this shall not be unto thee.

 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan
thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be
of God, but those that be of men.

 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his
soul?   For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father
with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his
works.

 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall
not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his
kingdom.

 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,  And
was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun, and
his raiment was white as the light.

 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him.

 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us
to be here if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for
thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them and
behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
were sore afraid.

 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
afraid.

 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
Jesus only.

 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again
from the dead.

 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
that Elias must first come?   And Jesus answered and said unto
them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.

 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall
also the Son of man suffer of them.

 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
the Baptist.

 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  Lord, have mercy
on my son for he is lunatick, and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth
into the fire, and oft into the water.

 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?
bring him hither to me.

 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him and the
child was cured from that very hour.

 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not
we cast him out?   And Jesus said unto them, Because of your
unbelief for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men  And they shall
kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.

And they were exceeding sorry.

 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings
of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of
strangers?   Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto
him, Then are the children free.

 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea,
and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when
thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money that
take, and give unto them for me and thee.

 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?   And Jesus called a little
child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  And said,
Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little
children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me.

 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that
offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast
them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into
everlasting fire.

 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of
my Father which is in heaven.

 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?   And if so be
that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that
sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.

 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
that one of these little ones should perish.

 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell
him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.

 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established.

 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church
but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican.

 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven.

 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of
my Father which is in heaven.

 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
am I in the midst of them.

 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?   Jesus
saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times but, Until
seventy times seven.

 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,
which would take account of his servants.

 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which
owed him ten thousand talents.

 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be
sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to
be made.

 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on
him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.

 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

 And he would not but went and cast him into prison, till he
should pay the debt.

 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
desiredst me  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?   And his lord was
wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all
that was due unto him.

 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,
he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond
Jordan;  And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them
there.

 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto
him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  And
said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh?   Wherefore
they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.

 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing
of divorcement, and to put her away?   He saith unto them, Moses
because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your
wives but from the beginning it was not so.

 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it
be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery and
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
his wife, it is not good to marry.

 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save
they to whom it is given.

 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
mother's womb and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of
men and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.

 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should
put his hands on them, and pray and the disciples rebuked them.

 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to
come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good
thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?   And he said
unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that
is, God but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
bear false witness,  Honour thy father and thy mother and, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
my youth up what lack I yet?   Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt
be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me.

 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
sorrowful for he had great possessions.

 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That
a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
God.

 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
saying, Who then can be saved?   But Jesus beheld them, and said
unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are
possible.

 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?   And Jesus
said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me,
in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his
glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.

 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit
everlasting life.

 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
first.

 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers
into his vineyard.

 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
sent them into his vineyard.

 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
idle in the marketplace,  And said unto them; Go ye also into the
vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their
way.

 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
likewise.

 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day
idle?   They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith
unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that
shall ye receive.

 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from
the last unto the first.

 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they
received every man a penny.

 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
of the house,  Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and
thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and
heat of the day.

 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny?   Take that
thine is, and go thy way I will give unto this last, even as unto
thee.

 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
thine eye evil, because I am good?   So the last shall be first,
and the first last for many be called, but few chosen.

 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
in the way, and said unto them,  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;
and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto
the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,  And shall
deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify
him and the third day he shall rise again.

 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons,
worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant
that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the
other on the left, in thy kingdom.

 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are
able.

 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my
right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given
to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.

 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
against the two brethren.

 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are
great exercise authority upon them.

 But it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great
among you, let him be your minister;  And whosoever will be chief
among you, let him be your servant  Even as the Son of man came
not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a
ransom for many.

 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
him.

 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O
Lord, thou son of David.

 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
peace but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou
son of David.

 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
that I shall do unto you?   They say unto him, Lord, that our
eyes may be opened.

 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes and
immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her loose
them, and bring them unto me.

 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
need of them; and straightway he will send them.

 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet, saying,  Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy
King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the
foal of an ass.

 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,  And
brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they
set him thereon.

 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.

 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
saying, Hosanna to the son of David Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
saying, Who is this?   And the multitude said, This is Jesus the
prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.

 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the
moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,  And said
unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of
prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
healed them.

 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying,
Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,  And said
unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea;
have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise?   And he left them, and went out of the city
into Bethany; and he lodged there.

 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found
nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered
away.

 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon
is the fig tree withered away!   Jesus answered and said unto
them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall
not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall
say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
sea; it shall be done.

 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
shall receive.

 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the
elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By
what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this
authority?   And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will
ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you
by what authority I do these things.

 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And
they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven;
he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?   But if we
shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.

 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

 He answered and said, I will not but afterward he repented, and
went.

 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
and said, I go, sir and went not.

 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto
him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and
ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe
him.

 Hear another parable There was a certain householder, which
planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress
in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into
a far country  And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent
his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of
it.

 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
another, and stoned another.

 Again, he sent other servants more than the first and they did
unto them likewise.

 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
reverence my son.

 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his
inheritance.

 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew
him.

 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do
unto those husbandmen?   They say unto him, He will miserably
destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other
husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The
stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the
corner this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
they perceived that he spake of them.

 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
said,  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which
made a marriage for his son,  And sent forth his servants to call
them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come.

 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
killed, and all things are ready come unto the marriage.

 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,
another to his merchandise  And the remnant took his servants,
and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.

 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth and he sent forth
his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
which were bidden were not worthy.

 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
bid to the marriage.

 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
together all as many as they found, both bad and good and the wedding
was furnished with guests.

 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
which had not on a wedding garment  And he saith unto him,
Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he
was speechless.

 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 For many are called, but few are chosen.

 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
entangle him in his talk.

 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of
God in truth, neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not
the person of men.

 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
tribute unto Caesar, or not?   But Jesus perceived their
wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?   Shew me
the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the
things that are God's.

 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
and went their way.

 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is
no resurrection, and asked him,  Saying, Master, Moses said, If a
man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and
raise up seed unto his brother.

 Now there were with us seven brethren and the first, when he
had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto
his brother  Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the
seventh.

 And last of all the woman died also.

 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
seven?  for they all had her.

 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
scriptures, nor the power of God.

 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  God is not the
God of the dead, but of the living.

 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
doctrine.

 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
to silence, they were gathered together.

 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
tempting him, and saying,  Master, which is the great commandment
in the law?   Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

 This is the first and great commandment.

 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.

 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto
him, The son of David.

 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
saying,  The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
till I make thine enemies thy footstool?   If David then call him
Lord, how is he his son?   And no man was able to answer him a
word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more
questions.

 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 
Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat  All
therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do
not ye after their works for they say, and do not.

 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers.

 But all their works they do for to be seen of men they make
broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
the synagogues,  And greetings in the markets, and to be called of
men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

 But be not ye called Rabbi for one is your Master, even Christ;
and all ye are brethren.

 And call no man your father upon the earth for one is your
Father, which is in heaven.

 Neither be ye called masters for one is your Master, even
Christ.

 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
shall humble himself shall be exalted.

 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut
up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves,
neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye
shall receive the greater damnation.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.

 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear
by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of
the temple, he is a debtor!   Ye fools and blind for whether is
greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  
And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever
sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

 Ye fools and blind for whether is greater, the gift, or the
altar that sanctifieth the gift?   Whoso therefore shall swear by
the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.

 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him
that dwelleth therein.

 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier
matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith these ought ye to have
done, and not to leave the other undone.

 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are
full of extortion and excess.

 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup
and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within
ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the
righteous,  And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers,
we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets.

 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
children of them which killed the prophets.

 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
damnation of hell?   Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets,
and wise men, and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify;
and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
them from city to city  That upon you may come all the righteous
blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the
blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple
and the altar.

 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
generation.

 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not!   Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate.

 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple and his
disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I
say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another,
that shall not be thrown down.

 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto
him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive
you.

 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
deceive many.

 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not
troubled for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not
yet.

 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,
in divers places.

 All these are the beginning of sorrows.

 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
and shall hate one another.

 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
cold.

 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso
readeth, let him understand)  Then let them which be in Judaea
flee into the mountains  Let him which is on the housetop not
come down to take any thing out of his house  Neither let him
which is in the field return back to take his clothes.

 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
suck in those days!   But pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter, neither on the sabbath day  For then shall be great
tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this
time, no, nor ever shall be.

 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.

 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
there; believe it not.

 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

 Behold, I have told you before.

 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
desert; go not forth behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it
not.

 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
gathered together.

 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken 
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then
shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one
end of heaven to the other.

 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh 
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is
near, even at the doors.

 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
these things be fulfilled.

 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
away.

 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
heaven, but my Father only.

 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son
of man be.

 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark,  And knew not until the flood came, and
took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
other left.

 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,
and the other left.

 Watch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not
have suffered his house to be broken up.

 Therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not
the Son of man cometh.

 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
doing.

 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
goods.

 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
delayeth his coming;  And shall begin to smite his
fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  The lord
of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and
in an hour that he is not aware of,  And shall cut him asunder,
and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
them  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him.

 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
lamps are gone out.

 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
yourselves.

 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut.

 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
to us.

 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh.

 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods.

 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
straightway took his journey.

 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same, and made them other five talents.

 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord's money.

 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
reckoneth with them.

 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents
behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
servant thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents behold, I have gained two other
talents beside them.

 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
and gathering where thou hast not strawed  And I was afraid, and
went and hid thy talent in the earth lo, there thou hast that is
thine.

 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
own with usury.

 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents.

 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.

 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory 
And before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats  And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the
goats on the left.

 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me
meat I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink I was a stranger, and ye
took me in  Naked, and ye clothed me I was sick, and ye visited
me I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed
thee?   Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto
thee?   And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat I was
thirsty, and ye gave me no drink  I was a stranger, and ye took
me not in naked, and ye clothed me not sick, and in prison, and ye
visited me not.

 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in
prison, and did not minister unto thee?   Then shall he answer
them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the
righteous into life eternal.

 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
he said unto his disciples,  Ye know that after two days is the
feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was
called Caiaphas,  And consulted that they might take Jesus by
subtilty, and kill him.

 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
among the people.

 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.

 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To
what purpose is this waste?   For this ointment might have been
sold for much, and given to the poor.

 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it
for my burial.

 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done,
be told for a memorial of her.

 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
chief priests,  And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I
will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty
pieces of silver.

 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for
thee to eat the passover?   And he said, Go into the city to such
a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will
keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.

 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
ready the passover.

 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of
you shall betray me.

 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?   And he answered and said, He
that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.

 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that
man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man
if he had not been born.

 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it
I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.

 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is
my body.

 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it;  For this is my blood of the new
testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's
kingdom.

 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Olives.

 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and
saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death tarry ye here, and watch with me.

 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh is weak.

 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy
will be done.

 And he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were
heavy.

 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
time, saying the same words.

 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
now, and take your rest behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

 Rise, let us be going behold, he is at hand that doth betray
me.

 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief
priests and elders of the people.

 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
shall kiss, that same is he hold him fast.

 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
kissed him.

 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his
hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's,
and smote off his ear.

 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?   But how
then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily
with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might
be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,
and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  But found
none yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At
the last came two false witnesses,  And said, This fellow said, I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?   But Jesus
held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I
adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the
Christ, the Son of God.

 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said nevertheless I say unto
you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand
of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have
heard his blasphemy.

 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
smote him with the palms of their hands,  Saying, Prophesy unto
us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?   Now Peter sat
without in the palace and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also
wast with Jesus of Galilee.

 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
sayest.

 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth.

 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
thee.

 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.

 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and
wept bitterly.

 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death  And
when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to
Pontius Pilate the governor.

 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders,  Saying, I have sinned in
that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that
to us? see thou to that.

 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
departed, and went and hanged himself.

 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of
blood.

 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.

 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
day.

 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him
that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; 
And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

 And Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him,
saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou
sayest.

 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
answered nothing.

 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
witness against thee?   And he answered him to never a word;
insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.

 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
people a prisoner, whom they would.

 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which
is called Christ?   For he knew that for envy they had delivered
him.

 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person see
ye to it.

 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and
on our children.

 Then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged
Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
his head, and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!   And they
spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.

 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.

 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name
him they compelled to bear his cross.

 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
say, a place of a skull,  They gave him vinegar to drink mingled
with gall and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They
parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

 And sitting down they watched him there;  And set up over
his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
hand, and another on the left.

 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 
And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
cross.

 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
and elders, said,  He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he
be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we
will believe him.

 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him
for he said, I am the Son of God.

 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
in his teeth.

 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour.

 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?   Some of them that stood there, when they
heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.

 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
save him.

 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
ghost.

 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept
arose,  And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and
went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they
feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him  Among which was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of
Zebedees children.

 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple  He went to
Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body
to be delivered.

 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth,  And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn
out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulchre, and departed.

 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
against the sepulchre.

 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  Saying,
Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,
After three days I will rise again.

 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and
say unto the people, He is risen from the dead so the last error
shall be worse than the first.

 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch go your way, make it as
sure as ye can.

 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
and setting a watch.

 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
sepulchre.

 And, behold, there was a great earthquake for the angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from
the door, and sat upon it.

 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
snow  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as
dead men.

 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye for
I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

 He is not here for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place
where the Lord lay.

 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye
see him lo, I have told you.

 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great
joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and
worshipped him.

 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid go tell my brethren
that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were
done.

 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,  Saying, Say
ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.

 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
and secure you.

 So they took the money, and did as they were taught and this
saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

 And when they saw him, they worshipped him but some doubted.

 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
unto me in heaven and in earth.

 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost 
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you
and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.




The Gospel According to Saint Mark


 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 
As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before
thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make his paths straight.

 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins.

 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
confessing their sins.

 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;  And
preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

 I indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you
with the Holy Ghost.

 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him  And there
came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased.

 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.

 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,  And saying, The time
is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand repent ye, and
believe the gospel.

 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers.

 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you
to become fishers of men.

 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship
mending their nets.

 And straightway he called them and they left their father
Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.

 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day
he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

 And they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as
one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
and he cried out,  Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with
thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee
who thou art, the Holy One of God.

 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
him.

 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.

 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for
with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do
obey him.

 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
round about Galilee.

 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell
him of her.

 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that
were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

 And all the city was gathered together at the door.

 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they
knew him.

 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went
out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for
thee.

 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may
preach there also for therefore came I forth.

 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
cast out devils.

 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched
him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
from him, and he was cleansed.

 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man but go thy way,
shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things
which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into
the city, but was without in desert places and they came to him from
every quarter.

 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was
noised that he was in the house.

 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there
was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door and he
preached the word unto them.

 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was
borne of four.

 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up, they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning
in their hearts,  Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can
forgive sins but God only?   And immediately when Jesus perceived
in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto
them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?   Whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?   But that ye may
know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he
saith to the sick of the palsy,)  I say unto thee, Arise, and take
up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.

 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before
them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God,
saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
resorted unto him, and he taught them.

 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at
the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and
followed him.

 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his
disciples for there were many, and they followed him.

 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publicans and sinners?   When Jesus heard it, he
saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician,
but they that are sick I came not to call the righteous, but sinners
to repentance.

 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast and
they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?   And Jesus said unto
them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom
is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they
cannot fast.

 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else
the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent
is made worse.

 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine
doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will
be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles.

 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears
of corn.

 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
sabbath day that which is not lawful?   And he said unto them,
Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an
hungred, he, and they that were with him?   How he went into the
house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the
shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave
also to them which were with him?   And he said unto them, The
sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath  Therefore
the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
which had a withered hand.

 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
day; that they might accuse him.

 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
forth.

 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their
peace.

 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man,
Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out and his hand was
restored whole as the other.

 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with
the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a
great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,  And
from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they
about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what
great things he did, came unto him.

 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on
him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for
to touch him, as many as had plagues.

 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.

 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
would and they came unto him.

 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he
might send them forth to preach,  And to have power to heal
sicknesses, and to cast out devils  And Simon he surnamed Peter;
 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and
he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder  And
Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and
James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him and they went into
an house.

 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not
so much as eat bread.

 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
him for they said, He is beside himself.

 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How
can Satan cast out Satan?   And if a kingdom be divided against
itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
stand.

 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot
stand, but hath an end.

 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods,
except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his
house.

 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme 
But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
without, sent unto him, calling him.

 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold,
thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
Behold my mother and my brethren!   For whosoever shall do the
will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

 And he began again to teach by the sea side and there was
gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship,
and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the
land.

 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in
his doctrine,  Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow 
And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the
fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth  But
when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it
withered away.

 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
and it yielded no fruit.

 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up
and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and
some an hundred.

 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve
asked of him the parable.

 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without, all these
things are done in parables  That seeing they may see, and not
perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any
time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
will ye know all parables?   The sower soweth the word.

 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the
word that was sown in their hearts.

 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time
afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
immediately they are offended.

 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
word,  And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of
riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and
it becometh unfruitful.

 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some
sixty, and some an hundred.

 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?   For
there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any
thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.

 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear with what measure
ye mete, it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall
more be given.

 For he that hath, to him shall be given and he that hath not,
from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
seed into the ground;  And should sleep, and rise night and day,
and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,
then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
the sickle, because the harvest is come.

 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with
what comparison shall we compare it?   It is like a grain of
mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all
the seeds that be in the earth  But when it is sown, it groweth
up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great
branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of
it.

 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they
were able to hear it.

 But without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were
alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let
us pass over unto the other side.

 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as
he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.

 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
the ship, so that it was now full.

 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow
and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we
perish?   And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the
sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
have no faith?   And they feared exceedingly, and said one to
another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea
obey him?   And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into
the country of the Gadarenes.

 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him
out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,  Who had his
dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with
chains  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and
chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the
fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him.

 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,  And
cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment
me not.

 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.

 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My
name is Legion for we are many.

 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of
the country.

 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
feeding.

 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine,
that we may enter into them.

 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
out, and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a
steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were
choked in the sea.

 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in
the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.

 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right
mind and they were afraid.

 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for
thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel.

 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,
much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea.

 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,  And
besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of
death I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be
healed; and she shall live.

 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
thronged him.

 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
touched his garment.

 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.

 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she
felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my
clothes?   And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the
multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?   And
he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;
go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's
house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the
Master any further?   As soon as Jesus heard the word that was
spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only
believe.

 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and
John the brother of James.

 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,
he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were
with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.

 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the
age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
astonishment.

 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
commanded that something should be given her to eat.

 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and
his disciples follow him.

 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
synagogue and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence
hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given
unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?  
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and
Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?
And they were offended at him.

 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in
his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
about the villages, teaching.

 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by
two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;  And
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a
staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse  But be
shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against
them.

Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
were sick, and healed them.

 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad)
and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and
therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
prophet, or as one of the prophets.

 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
beheaded he is risen from the dead.

 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife for
he had married her.

 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have
thy brother's wife.

 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
killed him; but she could not  For Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he
heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.

 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of
Galilee;  And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said
unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it
thee.

 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask?
And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of
John the Baptist.

 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and
for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel and the
damsel gave it to her mother.

 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had
taught.

 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
place, and rest a while for there were many coming and going, and
they had no leisure so much as to eat.

 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together
unto him.

 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a
shepherd and he began to teach them many things.

 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,
and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed 
Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and
into the villages, and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to
eat.

 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and
give them to eat?   He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?
go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
green grass.

 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them
to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he
among them all.

 And they did all eat, and were filled.

 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
fishes.

 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.

 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent
away the people.

 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
pray.

 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and
he alone on the land.

 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them,
walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had
been a spirit, and cried out  For they all saw him, and were
troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be
of good cheer it is I; be not afraid.

 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased and
they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.

 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their
heart was hardened.

 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
him,  And ran through that whole region round about, and began to
carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.

 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they
might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as
touched him were made whole.

 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,
that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.

 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
not.

And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as
the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with
unwashen hands?   He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias
prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth
me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.

 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
men, as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things
ye do.

 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
that ye may keep your own tradition.

 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
curseth father or mother, let him die the death  But ye say, If a
man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a
gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.

 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
mother;  Making the word of God of none effect through your
tradition, which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye.

 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand  There is
nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him but
the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.

 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
disciples asked him concerning the parable.

 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do
ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the
man, it cannot defile him;  Because it entereth not into his
heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all
meats?   And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that
defileth the man.

 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders,  Thefts, covetousness,
wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride,
foolishness  All these evil things come from within, and defile
the man.

 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it but
he could not be hid.

 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
heard of him, and came and fell at his feet  The woman was a
Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would
cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled for it
is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the
dogs.

 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord yet the dogs under
the table eat of the children's crumbs.

 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
gone out of thy daughter.

 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,
and her daughter laid upon the bed.

 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.

 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  And looking
up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be
opened.

 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

 And he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he
charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; 
And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things
well he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

 In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing
to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me
three days, and have nothing to eat  And if I send them away
fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way for divers of
them came from far.

 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
these men with bread here in the wilderness?   And he asked them,
How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.

 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took
the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his
disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.

 And they had a few small fishes and he blessed, and commanded to
set them also before them.

 So they did eat, and were filled and they took up of the broken
meat that was left seven baskets.

 And they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them
away.

 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no
sign be given unto this generation.

 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
the other side.

 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they
in the ship with them more than one loaf.

 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
no bread.

 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand?
have ye your heart yet hardened?   Having eyes, see ye not? and
having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?   When I brake
the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.

 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?  
And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and
besought him to touch him.

 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he
asked him if he saw ought.

 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
look up and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
town, nor tell it to any in the town.

 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them,
Whom do men say that I am?   And they answered, John the Baptist;
but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.

 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and
scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
rebuke him.

 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan for thou savourest
not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.

 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save
it.

 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul?   Or what shall a man give in exchange for
his soul?   Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my
words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels.

 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some
of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they
have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves
and he was transfigured before them.

 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
fuller on earth can white them.

 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses and they were
talking with Jesus.

 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to
be here and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias.

 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out
of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son hear him.

 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man
any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were
risen from the dead.

 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with
another what the rising from the dead should mean.

 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must
first come?   And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh
first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of
man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about
them, and the scribes questioning with them.

 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?   And
one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto
thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;  And wheresoever he taketh
him, he teareth him and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and
pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him
out; and they could not.

 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.

 And they brought him unto him and when he saw him, straightway
the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
him?  And he said, Of a child.

 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,
to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us,
and help us.

 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
possible to him that believeth.

 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked
the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge
thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.

 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him and
he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
privately, Why could not we cast him out?   And he said unto them,
This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.

 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
would not that any man should know it.

 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man
is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after
that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.

 And he came to Capernaum and being in the house he asked them,
What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?   But
they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among
themselves, who should be the greatest.

 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If
any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant
of all.

 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them and when
he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,  Whosoever shall
receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me and whosoever
shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
devils in thy name, and he followeth not us and we forbad him,
because he followeth not us.

 But Jesus said, Forbid him not for there is no man which shall
do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.

 For he that is not against us is on our part.

 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
his reward.

 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe
in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck, and he were cast into the sea.

 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off it is better for thee to
enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into
the fire that never shall be quenched  Where their worm dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.

 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off it is better for thee to
enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into
the fire that never shall be quenched  Where their worm dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched.

 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out it is better for thee
to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to
be cast into hell fire  Where their worm dieth not, and the fire
is not quenched.

 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
shall be salted with salt.

 Salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith
will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with
another.

 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by
the farther side of Jordan and the people resort unto him again; and,
as he was wont, he taught them again.

 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a
man to put away his wife? tempting him.

 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and
to put her away.

 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your
heart he wrote you this precept.

 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
female.

 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
cleave to his wife;  And they twain shall be one flesh so then
they are no more twain, but one flesh.

 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
matter.

 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
marry another, committeth adultery against her.

 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
another, she committeth adultery.

 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not
for of such is the kingdom of God.

 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
blessed them.

 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,
and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I
may inherit eternal life?   And Jesus said unto him, Why callest
thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.

 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy
father and mother.   And he answered and said unto him, Master,
all these have I observed from my youth.

 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing
thou lackest go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come, take up the
cross, and follow me.

 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved for he had
great possessions.

 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for
them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!   It
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
themselves, Who then can be saved?   And Jesus looking upon them
saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God for with God all
things are possible.

 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
followed thee.

 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no
man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
before them and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were
afraid.

And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things
should happen unto him,  Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;
and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto
the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver
him to the Gentiles  And they shall mock him, and shall scourge
him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him and the third day he
shall rise again.

 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire.

 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask can ye drink
of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with?   And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said
unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with
the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized  But
to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but
it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with
James and John.

 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that
they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.

 But so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great
among you, shall be your minister  And whosoever of you will be
the chiefest, shall be servant of all.

 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

 And they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

 And many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried
the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.

 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they
call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he
calleth thee.

 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might
receive my sight.

 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
whole.

And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 
And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you
and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied,
whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.

 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,
loosing the colt?   And they said unto them even as Jesus had
commanded and they let them go.

 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
him; and he sat upon him.

 And many spread their garments in the way and others cut down
branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord 
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of
the Lord Hosanna in the highest.

 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple and when
he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was
come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
hungry  And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came,
if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it, he
found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

 And they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple, and
began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that
sold doves;  And would not suffer that any man should carry any
vessel through the temple.

 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made
it a den of thieves.

 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
might destroy him for they feared him, because all the people was
astonished at his doctrine.

 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
dried up from the roots.

 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold,
the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall
not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he
saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
any that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
trespasses.

 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
heaven forgive your trespasses.

 And they come again to Jerusalem and as he was walking in the
temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the
elders,  And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these
things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?  
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one
question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do
these things.

 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?   But if we
shall say, Of men; they feared the people for all men counted John,
that he was a prophet indeed.

 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I
do these things.

 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for
the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went
into a far country.

 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully
handled.

 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
beating some, and killing some.

 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also
last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
vineyard.

 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
builders rejected is become the head of the corner  This was the
Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?   And they sought
to lay hold on him, but feared the people for they knew that he had
spoken the parable against them and they left him, and went their
way.

 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians, to catch him in his words.

 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
thou art true, and carest for no man for thou regardest not the
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth Is it lawful to
give tribute to Caesar, or not?   Shall we give, or shall we not
give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye
me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.

 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image
and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they
marvelled at him.

 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  Master, Moses wrote
unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and
leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
seed unto his brother.

 Now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife, and
dying left no seed.

 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed and
the third likewise.

 And the seven had her, and left no seed last of all the woman
died also.

 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  
For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are
given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

 And as touching the dead, that they rise have ye not read in
the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living ye therefore
do greatly err.

 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,
Which is the first commandment of all?   And Jesus answered him,
The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God
is one Lord  And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength this is the first commandment.

 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than
these.

 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
truth for there is one God; and there is none other but he  And
to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and
with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his
neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices.

 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that
durst ask him any question.

 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How
say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?   For David
himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on
my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then
his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
marketplaces,  And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the
uppermost rooms at feasts  Which devour widows' houses, and for
a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation.

 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in
much.

 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
which make a farthing.

 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than
all they which have cast into the treasury  For all they did
cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that
she had, even all her living.

 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
buildings?  there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall
not be thrown down.

 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,  Tell us,
when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these
things shall be fulfilled?   And Jesus answering them began to
say, Take heed lest any man deceive you  For many shall come in
my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.

 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
troubled for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.

 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there
shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows.

 But take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to
councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be
brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against
them.

 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate but
whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye for it is
not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.

 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and
shall cause them to be put to death.

 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that
shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that
readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the
mountains  And let him that is on the housetop not go down into
the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house
 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
up his garment.

 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck
in those days!   And pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter.

 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither
shall be.

 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
should be saved but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he
hath shortened the days.

 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
lo, he is there; believe him not  For false Christs and false
prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if
it were possible, even the elect.

 But take ye heed behold, I have foretold you all things.

 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,  And the stars
of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be
shaken.

 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with
great power and glory.

 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his
elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven.

 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near 
So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass,
know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till
all these things be done.

 Heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away.

 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

 Take ye heed, watch and pray for ye know not when the time is.

 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his
work, and commanded the porter to watch.

 Watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the
morning  Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might
take him by craft, and put him to death.

 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of
the people.

 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his
head.

 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?   For it might have
been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to
the poor. And they murmured against her.

 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
wrought a good work on me.

 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good but me ye have not always.

 She hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my
body to the burying.

 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be
spoken of for a memorial of her.

 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
priests, to betray him unto them.

 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and
prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?   And he sendeth forth
two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and
there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him.

 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
the passover with my disciples?   And he will shew you a large
upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us.

 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found
as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover.

 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,
Is it I? and another said, Is it I?   And he answered and said
unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.

 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him but woe to
that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man
if he had never been born.

 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat this is my body.

 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to
them and they all drank of it.

 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
which is shed for many.

 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Olives.

 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep shall be scattered.

 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
will not I.

 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me
thrice.

 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane and he
saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  And saith unto them, My soul
is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here, and watch.

 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.

 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will, but what
thou wilt.

 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?   Watch
ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,
but the flesh is weak.

 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away
safely.

 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant
of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?   I was
daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not but the
scriptures must be fulfilled.

 And they all forsook him, and fled.

 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him 
And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

 And they led Jesus away to the high priest and with him were
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
high priest and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the
fire.

 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
agreed not together.

 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
saying,  We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is
made with hands, and within three days I will build another made
without hands.

 But neither so did their witness agree together.

 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against
thee?   But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the
high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son
of the Blessed?   And Jesus said, I am and ye shall see the Son
of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
heaven.

 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
any further witnesses?   Ye have heard the blasphemy what think
ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.

 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy and the servants did strike
him with the palms of their hands.

 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
maids of the high priest  And when she saw Peter warming
himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus
of Nazareth.

 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.

 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
by, This is one of them.

 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them for thou art a
Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.

 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man
of whom ye speak.

 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the
word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt
deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and
bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

 And the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered
nothing.

 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
behold how many things they witness against thee.

 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
they desired.

 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that
had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the
insurrection.

 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
had ever done unto them.

 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you
the King of the Jews?   For he knew that the chief priests had
delivered him for envy.

 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
release Barabbas unto them.

 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then
that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?   And
they cried out again, Crucify him.

 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be
crucified.

 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;
and they call together the whole band.

 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,
and put it about his head,  And began to salute him, Hail, King
of the Jews!   And they smote him on the head with a reed, and
did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
interpreted, The place of a skull.

 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he
received it not.

 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
KING OF THE JEWS.

 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
hand, and the other on his left.

 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
numbered with the transgressors.

 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
days,  Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled
him.

 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.

 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?   And some of them that stood by,
when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether
Elias will come to take him down.

 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom.

 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was
the Son of God.

 There were also women looking on afar off among whom was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
Salome;  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto
Jerusalem.

 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
that is, the day before the sabbath,  Joseph of Arimathaea, an
honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came,
and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto
him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
Joseph.

 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in
the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,
and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he
was laid.

 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might
come and anoint him.

 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre?   And when they looked, they saw
that the stone was rolled away for it was very great.

 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on
the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were
affrighted.

 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted Ye seek Jesus of
Nazareth, which was crucified he is risen; he is not here behold the
place where they laid him.

 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
before you into Galilee there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.

 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man; for
they were afraid.

 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven
devils.

 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
mourned and wept.

 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
seen of her, believed not.

 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
walked, and went into the country.

 And they went and told it unto the residue neither believed
they them.

 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.

 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature.

 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
believeth not shall be damned.

 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall
they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  They
shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall
not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall
recover.

 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up
into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working
with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.



The Gospel According to Saint Luke


 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;  It seemed good to me
also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very
first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou
hast been instructed.

 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they
both were now well stricken in years.

 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office
before God in the order of his course,  According to the custom of
the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the
temple of the Lord.

 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
time of incense.

 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
right side of the altar of incense.

 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
him.

 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias for thy prayer
is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt
call his name John.

 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at
his birth.

 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy
Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
their God.

 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to
turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to
the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for
I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand
in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew
thee these glad tidings.

 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not
my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.

 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
tarried so long in the temple.

 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them and they
perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned
unto them, and remained speechless.

 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
herself five months, saying,  Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in
the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.

 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
city of Galilee, named Nazareth,  To a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name
was Mary.

 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
highly favoured, the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women.

 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in
her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary for thou hast found
favour with God.

 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest
and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David
 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
kingdom there shall be no end.

 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know
not a man?   And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.

 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son
in her old age and this is the sixth month with her, who was called
barren.

 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
haste, into a city of Juda;  And entered into the house of
Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost  And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come
to me?   For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded
in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

 And blessed is she that believed for there shall be a
performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,  And my spirit
hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for,
behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is
his name.

 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
generation.

 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud
in the imagination of their hearts.

 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of
low degree.

 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath
sent empty away.

 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her
own house.

 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and
she brought forth a son.

 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of
his father.

 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called
John.

 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
called by this name.

 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.

 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is
John. And they marvelled all.

 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and
he spake, and praised God.

 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these
sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.

 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord
was with him.

 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
prophesied, saying,  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he
hath visited and redeemed his people,  And hath raised up an horn
of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;  As he
spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the
world began  That we should be saved from our enemies, and from
the hand of all that hate us;  To perform the mercy promised to
our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;  The oath which he
sware to our father Abraham,  That he would grant unto us, that we
being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without
fear,  In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of
our life.

 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest for
thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  To
give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their
sins,  Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
from on high hath visited us,  To give light to them that sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of
peace.

 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria.)   And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;
(because he was of the house and lineage of David)  To be taxed
with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.

 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be delivered.

 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room
for them in the inn.

 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night.

 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of
the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid.

 And the angel said unto them, Fear not for, behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord.

 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying,  Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will toward men.

 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into
heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto
Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord
hath made known unto us.

 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
babe lying in a manger.

 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
which was told them concerning this child.

 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
told them by the shepherds.

 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.

 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the
child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel
before he was conceived in the womb.

 And when the days of her purification according to the law of
Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him
to the Lord;  (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male
that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)  And to
offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the
Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;
and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of
Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

 And he came by the Spirit into the temple and when the parents
brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word  For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,  Which thou hast
prepared before the face of all people;  A light to lighten the
Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
spoken of him.

 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and
for a sign which shall be spoken against;  (Yea, a sword shall
pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts
may be revealed.

 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Aser she was of a great age, and had lived with an
husband seven years from her virginity;  And she was a widow of
about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple,
but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.

 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in
Jerusalem.

 And when they had performed all things according to the law of
the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
wisdom and the grace of God was upon him.

 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
passover.

 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after
the custom of the feast.

 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child
Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not
of it.

 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.

 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
seeking him.

 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the
temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and
asking them questions.

 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
answers.

 And when they saw him, they were amazed and his mother said unto
him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I
have sought thee sorrowing.

 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not
that I must be about my Father's business?   And they understood
not the saying which he spake unto them.

 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject
unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God
and man.

 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,  Annas and
Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the
son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;  As it is written
in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of
one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
paths straight.

 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough
ways shall be made smooth;  And all flesh shall see the salvation
of God.

 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of
him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the
wrath to come?   Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance,
and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father
for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham.

 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every
tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?   He
answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart
to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.

 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
Master, what shall we do?   And he said unto them, Exact no more
than that which is appointed you.

 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall
we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse
any falsely; and be content with your wages.

 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;  John
answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but
one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,
and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn
with fire unquenchable.

 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people.

 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him,
and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in
thee I am well pleased.

 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
(as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, 
Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the
son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of
Joseph,  Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of
Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was
the son of Nagge,  Which was the son of Maath, which was the son

which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was
the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,  Which was the

which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,  Which was
the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of
Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, 
Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the
son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of
Eliakim,  Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan,
which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was
the son of David,  Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son
of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which
was the son of Naasson,  Which was the son of Aminadab, which was
the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of
Phares, which was the son of Juda,  Which was the son of Jacob,
which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was
the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,  Which was the son
of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec,
which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,  Which was
the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of
Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,  Which
was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the
son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of
Cainan,  Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth,
which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,  Being forty days
tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing and when
they were ended, he afterward hungered.

 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command
this stone that it be made bread.

 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto
him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and
the glory of them for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I
will I give it.

 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan
for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve.

 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the
temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
down from hence  For it is written, He shall give his angels
charge over thee, to keep thee  And in their hands they shall
bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord thy God.

 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from
him for a season.

 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee and
there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.

 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up and, as
his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
stood up for to read.

 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was
written,  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal
the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
bruised,  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and
sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him.

 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears.

 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's
son?   And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
proverb, Physician, heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in
Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his
own country.

 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days
of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when
great famine was throughout all the land;  But unto none of them
was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that
was a widow.

 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.

 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were
filled with wrath,  And rose up, and thrust him out of the city,
and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built,
that they might cast him down headlong.

 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,  And
came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the
sabbath days.

 And they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with
power.

 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,  Saying, Let us
alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou
come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.

 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
him.

And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him,
and hurt him not.

 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the
unclean spirits, and they come out.

 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
round about.

 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
house.

And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they
besought him for her.

 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her
and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every
one of them, and healed them.

 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou
art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to
speak for they knew that he was Christ.

 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place
and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he
should not depart from them.

 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other
cities also for therefore am I sent.

 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear
the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,  And saw two
ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them,
and were washing their nets.

 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat
down, and taught the people out of the ship.

 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into
the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the
night, and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word I will let
down the net.

 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of
fishes and their net brake.

 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled
both the ships, so that they began to sink.

 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken  And so was also James, and
John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus
said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all,
and followed him.

 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man
full of leprosy who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him,
saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will be
thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

 And he charged him to tell no man but go, and shew thyself to
the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded,
for a testimony unto them.

 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great
multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
infirmities.

 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were
come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem and the
power of the Lord was present to heal them.

 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
palsy and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before
him.

 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him
down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.

 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are
forgiven thee.

 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is
this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto
them, What reason ye in your hearts?   Whether is easier, to say,
Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?   But that
ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,
(he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take
up thy couch, and go into thine house.

 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon
he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled
with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named
Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him, Follow
me.

 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a
great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.

 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,
saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?   And
Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a
physician; but they that are sick.

 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,
and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but
thine eat and drink?   And he said unto them, Can ye make the
children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of
a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a
rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the
old.

 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine
will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.

 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
preserved.

 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for
he saith, The old is better.

 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he
went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of
corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.

 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which
is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?   And Jesus answering them
said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself
was an hungred, and they which were with him;  How he went into the
house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to
them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the
priests alone?   And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord
also of the sabbath.

 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into
the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was
withered.

 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal
on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.

 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and
stood forth.

 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful
on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to
destroy it?   And looking round about upon them all, he said unto
the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so and his hand was
restored whole as the other.

 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another
what they might do to Jesus.

 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples and of
them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  Simon, (whom
he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip
and Bartholomew,  Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,
and Simon called Zelotes,  And Judas the brother of James, and
Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.

 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all
Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which
came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  And they
that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed.

 And the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went
virtue out of him, and healed them all.

 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God.

 Blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled. Blessed
are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh.

 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out
your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy for, behold, your
reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets.

 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
consolation.

 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.

 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
which hate you,  Bless them that curse you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you.

 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat
also.

 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
away thy goods ask them not again.

 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
likewise.

 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
sinners also love those that love them.

 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have
ye?  for sinners also do even the same.

 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the
children of the Highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the
evil.

 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged condemn not, and ye shall
not be condemned forgive, and ye shall be forgiven  Give, and it
shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken
together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with
the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you
again.

 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
shall they not both fall into the ditch?   The disciple is not
above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his
master.

 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?   Either how
canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that
is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in
thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine
own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is
in thy brother's eye.

 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his
heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the
heart his mouth speaketh.

 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?   Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
them, I will shew you to whom he is like  He is like a man which
built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock
and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,
and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock.

 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a
foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did
beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house
was great.

 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
people, he entered into Capernaum.

 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
sick, and ready to die.

 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,
That he was worthy for whom he should do this  For he loveth our
nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the
house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord,
trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter
under my roof  Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come
unto thee but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,
and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him
about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I
have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
servant whole that had been sick.

 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was
a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow and much people of the city was with her.

 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
unto her, Weep not.

 And he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood
still.

And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered
him to his mother.

 And there came a fear on all and they glorified God, saying,
That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited
his people.

 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
throughout all the region round about.

 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we
for another?   And in that same hour he cured many of their
infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were
blind he gave sight.

 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John
what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to
the poor the gospel is preached.

 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness
for to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?   But what went ye out
for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they which are
gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.

 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,
and much more than a prophet.

 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is
not a greater prophet than John the Baptist but he that is least in
the kingdom of God is greater than he.

 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified
God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
themselves, being not baptized of him.

 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation? and to what are they like?   They are like unto
children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and
saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;
and ye say, He hath a devil.

 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
 But wisdom is justified of all her children.

 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an
alabaster box of ointment,  And stood at his feet behind him
weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with
the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment.

 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have
known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she
is a sinner.

 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say
unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed
five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?   Simon
answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.

And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my
feet but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the
hairs of her head.

 Thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in
hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

 My head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath
anointed my feet with ointment.

 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
forgiven; for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven, the same
loveth little.

 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?   And he said to
the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city
and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of
God and the twelve were with him,  And certain women, which had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene,
out of whom went seven devils,  And Joanna the wife of Chuza
Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto
him of their substance.

 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him
out of every city, he spake by a parable  A sower went out to sow
his seed and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was
trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.

 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
withered away, because it lacked moisture.

 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
choked it.

 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear.

 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God but to others in parables; that seeing they might not
see, and hearing they might not understand.

 Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God.

 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,
and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe
and be saved.

 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the
word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and
in time of temptation fall away.

 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have
heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of
this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good
heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with
patience.

 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,
or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they
which enter in may see the light.

 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither
any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.

 Take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath, to him shall
be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that
which he seemeth to have.

 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come
at him for the press.

 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy
brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are
these which hear the word of God, and do it.

 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
with his disciples and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the
other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

 But as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of
wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in
jeopardy.

 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we
perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the
water and they ceased, and there was a calm.

 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid
wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he
commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.

 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over
against Galilee.

 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a
certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither
abode in any house, but in the tombs.

 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son
of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
For oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains
and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil
into the wilderness.)   And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy
name? And he said, Legion because many devils were entered into him.

 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
into the deep.

 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter
into them. And he suffered them.

 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine
and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were
choked.

 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
and told it in the city and in the country.

 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and
found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the
feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind and they were afraid.

 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
possessed of the devils was healed.

 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great
fear and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.

 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
that he might be with him but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done
unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole
city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
gladly received him for they were all waiting for him.

 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of
the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that
he would come into his house  For he had one only daughter, about
twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people
thronged him.

 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment and
immediately her issue of blood stanched.

 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they
that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?   And Jesus said, Somebody
hath touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.

 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,
and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the
people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed
immediately.

 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort thy faith
hath made thee whole; go in peace.

 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not
the Master.

 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not
believe only, and she shall be made whole.

 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the
maiden.

 And all wept, and bewailed her but he said, Weep not; she is not
dead, but sleepeth.

 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
saying, Maid, arise.

 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway and he
commanded to give her meat.

 And her parents were astonished but he charged them that they
should tell no man what was done.

 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power
and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
sick.

 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two
coats apiece.

 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
depart.

 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,
shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
gospel, and healing every where.

 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he
was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen
from the dead;  And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of
others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.

 And Herod said, John have I beheaded but who is this, of whom I
hear such things? And he desired to see him.

 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they
had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert
place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

 And the people, when they knew it, followed him and he received
them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that
had need of healing.

 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the
towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals for we are
here in a desert place.

 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and
buy meat for all this people.

 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up
to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to
set before the multitude.

 And they did eat, and were all filled and there was taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were
with him and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
said, The Christ of God.

 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man
that thing;  Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and
be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain,
and be raised the third day.

 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever
will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
lose himself, or be cast away?   For whosoever shall be ashamed of
me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he
shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy
angels.

 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he
took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and
his raiment was white and glistering.

 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and
Elias  Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he
should accomplish at Jerusalem.

 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and
when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood
with him.

 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto
Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here and let us make three
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias not
knowing what he said.

 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them
and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
beloved Son hear him.

 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept
it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they
had seen.

 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
down from the hill, much people met him.

 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
beseech thee, look upon my son for he is mine only child.

 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it
teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth
from him.

 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.

 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.

 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
him.

And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and
delivered him again to his father.

 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto
his disciples,  Let these sayings sink down into your ears for
the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying.

 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be
greatest.

 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,
and set him by him,  And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive
this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me
receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all, the
same shall be great.

 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils
in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.

 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not for he that is not
against us is for us.

 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,  And
sent messengers before his face and they went, and entered into a
village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he
would go to Jerusalem.

 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume
them, even as Elias did?   But he turned, and rebuked them, and
said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
save them. And they went to another village.

 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man
said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me
first to go and bury my father.

 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead but go thou
and preach the kingdom of God.

 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first
go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,
whither he himself would come.

 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the
labourers are few pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he
would send forth labourers into his harvest.

 Go your ways behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes and salute no man by
the way.

 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this
house.

 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it
if not, it shall turn to you again.

 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as
they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house
to house.

 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
things as are set before you  And heal the sick that are therein,
and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go
your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,  Even the
very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against
you notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is
come nigh unto you.

 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day
for Sodom, than for that city.

 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in
you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and
ashes.

 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
judgment, than for you.

 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
thrust down to hell.

 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us through thy name.

 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven.

 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by
any means hurt you.

 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written
in heaven.

 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes even so,
Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

 All things are delivered to me of my Father and no man knoweth
who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son,
and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see  For I
tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those
things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things
which ye hear, and have not heard them.

 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?   He said unto
him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?   And he
answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right this do, and
thou shalt live.

 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is
my neighbour?   And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him
of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way and
when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked
on him, and passed by on the other side.

 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was and
when he saw him, he had compassion on him,  And went to him, and
bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own
beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and
whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him
that fell among the thieves?   And he said, He that shewed mercy
on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into
her house.

 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet,
and heard his word.

 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and
said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve
alone?  bid her therefore that she help me.

 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
careful and troubled about many things  But one thing is
needful and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken
away from her.

 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,
when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to
pray, as John also taught his disciples.

 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as
in heaven, so in earth.

 Give us day by day our daily bread.

 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
evil.

 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three
loaves;  For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I
have nothing to set before him?   And he from within shall answer
and say, Trouble me not the door is now shut, and my children are
with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he
is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give
him as many as he needeth.

 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he
give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a
serpent?   Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a
scorpion?   If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask him?   And he was casting out a
devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone
out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.

 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
the chief of the devils.

 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided
against a house falleth.

 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.

 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast
them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you.

 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
peace  But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and
overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted,
and divideth his spoils.

 He that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth.

 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return
unto my house whence I came out.

 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked
than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there and the last state
of that man is worse than the first.

 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the
womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.

 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
God, and keep it.

 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
say, This is an evil generation they seek a sign; and there shall no
sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
Son of man be to this generation.

 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
men of this generation, and condemn them for she came from the utmost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.

 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching
of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which
come in may see the light.

 The light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is
single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is
evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
darkness.

 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of
a candle doth give thee light.

 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
him and he went in, and sat down to meat.

 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first
washed before dinner.

 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of
ravening and wickedness.

 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
which is within also?   But rather give alms of such things as ye
have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.

 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God these
ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware
of them.

 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
thus saying thou reproachest us also.

 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens
with one of your fingers.

 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
your fathers killed them.

 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers
for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets
and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute 
That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation
of the world, may be required of this generation;  From the blood
of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar
and the temple verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this
generation.

 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
knowledge ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering
in ye hindered.

 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of
many things  Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something
out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon
another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of
the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither
hid, that shall not be known.

 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in
the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall
be proclaimed upon the housetops.

 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear Fear him, which after
he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear
him.

 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them
is forgotten before God?   But even the very hairs of your head
are all numbered. Fear not therefore ye are of more value than many
sparrows.

 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God  But
he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of
God.

 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy
Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall
answer, or what ye shall say  For the Holy Ghost shall teach you
in the same hour what ye ought to say.

 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
you?   And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of
covetousness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the
things which he possesseth.

 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
certain rich man brought forth plentifully  And he thought
within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where
to bestow my fruits?   And he said, This will I do I will pull
down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my
fruits and my goods.

 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
required of thee then whose shall those things be, which thou hast
provided?   So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is
not rich toward God.

 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body,
what ye shall put on.

 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

 Consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap; which
neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them how much more
are ye better than the fowls?   And which of you with taking
thought can add to his stature one cubit?   If ye then be not
able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the
rest?   Consider the lilies how they grow they toil not, they
spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these.

 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you,
O ye of little faith?   And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or
what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.

 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after and
your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
shall be added unto you.

 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the kingdom.

 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which
wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no
thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will
return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may
open unto him immediately.

 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
find watching verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and
make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.

 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have
suffered his house to be broken through.

 Be ye therefore ready also for the Son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not.

 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto
us, or even to all?   And the Lord said, Who then is that
faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his
household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?  
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
doing.

 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all
that he hath.

 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to
eat and drink, and to be drunken;  The lord of that servant will
come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is
not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his
portion with the unbelievers.

 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many
stripes.

 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given,
of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much, of
him they will ask the more.

 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
already kindled?   But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and
how am I straitened till it be accomplished!   Suppose ye that I
am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division
 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
three against two, and two against three.

 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against
the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against
the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the
daughter in law against her mother in law.

 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of
the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;
and it cometh to pass.

 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?   Yea, and
why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?   When thou
goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way,
give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale
thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the
officer cast thee into prison.

 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
the very last mite.

 There were present at that season some that told him of the
Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they
suffered such things?   I tell you, Nay but, except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish.

 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew
them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in
Jerusalem?   I tell you, Nay but, except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish.

 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted
in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.

 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none cut
it down; why cumbereth it the ground?   And he answering said unto
him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and
dung it  And if it bear fruit, well and if not, then after that
thou shalt cut it down.

 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up
herself.

 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

 And he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made
straight, and glorified God.

 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the
people, There are six days in which men ought to work in them
therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall,
and lead him away to watering?   And ought not this woman, being
a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen
years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?   And when he
had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed and all the
people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
whereunto shall I resemble it?   It is like a grain of mustard
seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and
waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of
it.

 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
of meal, till the whole was leavened.

 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
journeying toward Jerusalem.

 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
he said unto them,  Strive to enter in at the strait gate for
many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door,
saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto
you, I know you not whence ye are  Then shall ye begin to say,
We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our
streets.

 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of
God, and you yourselves thrust out.

 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of
God.

 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
first which shall be last.

 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
him, Get thee out, and depart hence for Herod will kill thee.

 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast
out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I
shall be perfected.

 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest
them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy
children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and
ye would not!   Behold, your house is left unto you desolate and
verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when
ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched
him.

 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
dropsy.

 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?   And they held their
peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;  And
answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen
into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
 And they could not answer him again to these things.

 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;
 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go
up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that
sit at meat with thee.

 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted.

 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither
thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again,
and a recompence be made thee.

 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
lame, the blind  And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of
the just.

 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the
kingdom of God.

 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
bade many  And sent his servant at supper time to say to them
that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.

 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go
and see it I pray thee have me excused.

 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
prove them I pray thee have me excused.

 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
come.

 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly
into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor,
and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
and yet there is room.

 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
shall taste of my supper.

 And there went great multitudes with him and he turned, and
said unto them,  If any man come to me, and hate not his father,
and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea,
and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot
be my disciple.

 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,  Saying, This
man began to build, and was not able to finish.

 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?   Or else,
while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and
desireth conditions of peace.

 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

 Salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
shall it be seasoned?   It is neither fit for the land, nor yet
for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let
him hear.

 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
him.

 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,  What man of
you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is
lost, until he find it?   And when he hath found it, he layeth it
on his shoulders, rejoicing.

 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my
sheep which was lost.

 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,
which need no repentance.

 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
diligently till she find it?   And when she hath found it, she
calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with
me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.

 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

 And he said, A certain man had two sons  And the younger
of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that
falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.

 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
substance with riotous living.

 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
land; and he began to be in want.

 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and
he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat and no man gave unto him.

 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,  And am no more
worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants.

 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and
fell on his neck, and kissed him.

 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.

 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet
 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
and be merry  For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he
was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

 Now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh
to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
meant.

 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.

 And he was angry, and would not go in therefore came his father
out, and intreated him.

 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment and
yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my
friends  But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath
devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf.

 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
have is thine.

 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad for this thy
brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he
had wasted his goods.

 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no
longer steward.

 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
lord taketh away from me the stewardship I cannot dig; to beg I am
ashamed.

 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said
unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?   And he said,
An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
sit down quickly, and write fifty.

 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and
write fourscore.

 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser
than the children of light.

 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
everlasting habitations.

 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?   And if
ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall
give you that which is your own?   No servant can serve two
masters for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else
he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God
and mammon.

 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
things and they derided him.

 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
before men; but God knoweth your hearts for that which is highly
esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

 The law and the prophets were until John since that time the
kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
of the law to fail.

 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from
her husband committeth adultery.

 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day  And there was a
certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of
sores,  And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from
the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
the angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died, and was
buried;  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and
seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool
my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things but now
he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither
can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
send him to my father's house  For I have five brethren; that he
may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
them hear them.

 And he said, Nay, father Abraham but if one went unto them from
the dead, they will repent.

 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
offences will come but woe unto him, through whom they come!   It
were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and
he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little
ones.

 Take heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee,
rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven
times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt
forgive him.

 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and
be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and
sit down to meat?   And will not rather say unto him, Make ready
wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten
and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?   Doth he
thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?
I trow not.

 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants we have done
that which was our duty to do.

 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men
that were lepers, which stood afar off  And they lifted up their
voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were
cleansed.

 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
and with a loud voice glorified God,  And fell down on his face
at his feet, giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan.

 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where
are the nine?   There are not found that returned to give glory
to God, save this stranger.

 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way thy faith hath made
thee whole.

 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh
not with observation  Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo
there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall
not see it.

 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there go not after
them, nor follow them.

 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under
heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the
Son of man be in his day.

 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
generation.

 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
days of the Son of man.

 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood
came, and destroyed them all.

 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  But
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone
from heaven, and destroyed them all.

 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
revealed.

 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff
in the house, let him not come down to take it away and he that is in
the field, let him likewise not return back.

 Remember Lot's wife.

 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the
one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
and the other left.

 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
other left.

 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
gathered together.

 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
always to pray, and not to faint;  Saying, There was in a city a
judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man  And there was
a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine
adversary.

 And he would not for a while but afterward he said within
himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;  Yet because this
widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming
she weary me.

 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with them?   I tell you that he will
avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall
he find faith on the earth?   And he spake this parable unto
certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and
despised others  Two men went up into the temple to pray; the
one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this publican.

 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
merciful to me a sinner.

 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased;
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
them but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of
God.

 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I
do to inherit eternal life?   And Jesus said unto him, Why
callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.

 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and
thy mother.

 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
thou one thing sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come, follow me.

 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful for he was very
rich.

 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?   And
he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.

 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,
for the kingdom of God's sake,  Who shall not receive manifold
more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we
go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets
concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on  And they shall
scourge him, and put him to death and the third day he shall rise
again.

 And they understood none of these things and this saying was
hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
certain blind man sat by the way side begging  And hearing the
multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
me.

 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
peace but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on
me.

 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him and
when he was come near, he asked him,  Saying, What wilt thou that
I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight thy faith hath saved
thee.

 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
glorifying God and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto
God.

 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief
among the publicans, and he was rich.

 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
press, because he was little of stature.

 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
him for he was to pass that way.

 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and
said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must
abide at thy house.

 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone
to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord Behold, Lord, the
half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing
from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.

 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost.

 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the
kingdom of God should immediately appear.

 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him,
to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man
had gained by trading.

 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
pounds.

 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant because thou hast
been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.

 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
pounds.

 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which
I have kept laid up in a napkin  For I feared thee, because thou
art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and
reapest that thou didst not sow.

 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up
that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow  Wherefore
then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might
have required mine own with usury?   And he said unto them that
stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten
pounds.

 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)   For I
say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from
him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.

 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
Jerusalem.

 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples,  Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in
the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet
never man sat loose him, and bring him hither.

 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had
said unto them.

 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto
them, Why loose ye the colt?   And they said, The Lord hath need
of him.

 And they brought him to Jesus and they cast their garments upon
the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount
of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had
seen;  Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
Lord peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from
thine eyes.

 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast
a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every
side,  And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;
because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
sold therein, and them that bought;  Saying unto them, It is
written, My house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of
thieves.

 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the
scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,  And
could not find what they might do for all the people were very
attentive to hear him.

 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the
people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and
the scribes came upon him with the elders,  And spake unto him,
saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is
he that gave thee this authority?   And he answered and said unto
them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me  The baptism
of John, was it from heaven, or of men?   And they reasoned with
themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why
then believed ye him not?   But and if we say, Of men; all the
people will stone us for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
do these things.

 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man
planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a
far country for a long time.

 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat
him, and sent him away empty.

 And again he sent another servant and they beat him also, and
entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

 And again he sent a third and they wounded him also, and cast
him out.

 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send
my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him.

 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
saying, This is the heir come, let us kill him, that the inheritance
may be ours.

 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?   He shall
come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to
others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.

 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of
the corner?   Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be
broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
lay hands on him; and they feared the people for they perceived that
he had spoken this parable against them.

 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so
they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.

 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but
teachest the way of God truly  Is it lawful for us to give
tribute unto Caesar, or no?   But he perceived their craftiness,
and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?   Shew me a penny. Whose
image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.

 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

 And they could not take hold of his words before the people and
they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there
is any resurrection; and they asked him,  Saying, Master, Moses
wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die
without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
seed unto his brother.

 There were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife,
and died without children.

 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also and
they left no children, and died.

 Last of all the woman died also.

 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
seven had her to wife.

 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
marry, and are given in marriage  But they which shall be
accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the
dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage  Neither can they
die any more for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children
of God, being the children of the resurrection.

 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.

 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living for all live
unto him.

 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
well said.

 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?
 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  Till I make thine
enemies thy footstool.

 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?  
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;  Which devour widows'
houses, and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive
greater damnation.

 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
the treasury.

 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
mites.

 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
cast in more than they all  For all these have of their abundance
cast in unto the offerings of God but she of her penury hath cast in
all the living that she had.

 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts, he said,  As for these things which ye behold,
the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone
upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things
be?  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall
come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near go ye
not therefore after them.

 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified
for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and
by.

 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom  And great earthquakes shall be in
divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and
great signs shall there be from heaven.

 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons,
being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.

 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what
ye shall answer  For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which
all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to
death.

 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

 In your patience possess ye your souls.

 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
that the desolation thereof is nigh.

 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that
are in the countries enter thereinto.

 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
written may be fulfilled.

 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land,
and wrath upon this people.

 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the waves roaring;  Men's hearts failing them for fear,
and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for
the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
power and great glory.

 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the
trees;  When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own
selves that summer is now nigh at hand.

 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till
all be fulfilled.

 Heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away.

 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,
and so that day come upon you unawares.

 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth.

 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to
stand before the Son of man.

 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of
Olives.

 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
temple, for to hear him.

 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
Passover.

 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him;
for they feared the people.

 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
number of the twelve.

 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
captains, how he might betray him unto them.

 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
in the absence of the multitude.

 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be
killed.

 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
passover, that we may eat.

 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?  
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city,
there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him
into the house where he entereth in.

 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover
with my disciples?   And he shall shew you a large upper room
furnished there make ready.

 And they went, and found as he had said unto them and they made
ready the passover.

 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
with him.

 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
passover with you before I suffer  For I say unto you, I will
not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
divide it among yourselves  For I say unto you, I will not drink
of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
them, saying, This is my body which is given for you this do in
remembrance of me.

 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new
testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
table.

 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined but woe
unto that man by whom he is betrayed!   And they began to enquire
among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
accounted the greatest.

 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are
called benefactors.

 But ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you, let
him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
serveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he
that serveth.

 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
unto me;  That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom,
and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
have you, that he may sift you as wheat  But I have prayed for
thee, that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren.

 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
into prison, and to death.

 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,
and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
take it, and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword, let him
sell his garment, and buy one.

 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors for
the things concerning me have an end.

 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
unto them, It is enough.

 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
enter not into temptation.

 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled
down, and prayed,  Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove
this cup from me nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening
him.

 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat
was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
he found them sleeping for sorrow,  And said unto them, Why sleep
ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto
Jesus to kiss him.

 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
with a kiss?   When they which were about him saw what would
follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
off his right ear.

 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
his ear, and healed him.

 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as
against a thief, with swords and staves?   When I was daily with
you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is
your hour, and the power of darkness.

 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
were set down together, Peter sat down among them.

 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is
a Galilaean.

 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow,
thou shalt deny me thrice.

 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,
and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?   And
many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their
council, saying,  Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto
them, If I tell you, ye will not believe  And if I also ask you,
ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
power of God.

 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
unto them, Ye say that I am.

 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we
ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.

 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
saying that he himself is Christ a King.

 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find
no fault in this man.

 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.

 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
Galilaean.

 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem
at that time.

 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad for he was
desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things
of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
nothing.

 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
him.

 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,
and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together
for before they were at enmity between themselves.

 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
the rulers and the people,  Said unto them, Ye have brought this
man unto me, as one that perverteth the people and, behold, I, having
examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching
those things whereof ye accuse him  No, nor yet Herod for I
sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.

 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
release unto us Barabbas  (Who for a certain sedition made in
the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)   Pilate
therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.

 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
done? I have found no cause of death in him I will therefore chastise
him, and let him go.

 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might
be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests
prevailed.

 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to
their will.

 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,
that he might bear it after Jesus.

 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
which also bewailed and lamented him.

 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
which never gave suck.

 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
to the hills, Cover us.

 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
in the dry?   And there were also two other, malefactors, led
with him to be put to death.

 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
and the other on the left.

 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the chosen of God.

 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
him vinegar,  And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save
thyself.

 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?   And we indeed
justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath
done nothing amiss.

 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom.

 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
thou be with me in paradise.

 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour.

 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst.

 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus, he gave up
the ghost.

 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
was a good man, and a just  (The same had not consented to the
counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews
who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested
the sabbath day according to the commandment.

 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had
prepared, and certain others with them.

 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments  And as they
were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto
them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?   He is not here, but
is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

 And they remembered his words,  And returned from the
sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the
rest.

 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,
and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the
apostles.

 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
them not.

 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,
he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed,
wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.

 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?   And the
one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou
only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are
come to pass there in these days?   And he said unto them, What
things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which
was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people
 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
condemned to death, and have crucified him.

 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
Israel and beside all this, to day is the third day since these
things were done.

 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
which were early at the sepulchre;  And when they found not his
body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels,
which said that he was alive.

 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not.

 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
all that the prophets have spoken  Ought not Christ to have
suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?   And
beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the things concerning himself.

 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went and he
made as though he would have gone further.

 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us for it is
toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with
them.

 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread,
and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
out of their sight.

 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,
while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the
scriptures?   And they rose up the same hour, and returned to
Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were
with them,  Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared
to Simon.

 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread.

 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
had seen a spirit.

 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts?   Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I
myself handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as
ye see me have.

 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
feet.

 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
unto them, Have ye here any meat?   And they gave him a piece of
a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

 And he took it, and did eat before them.

 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,
which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in
the psalms, concerning me.

 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
the scriptures,  And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus
it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day
 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

 And ye are witnesses of these things.

 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you but tarry
ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on
high.

 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them.

 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
them, and carried up into heaven.

 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
joy  And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing
God. Amen.



The Gospel According to Saint John


 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.

 The same was in the beginning with God.

 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
made that was made.

 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not.

 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
all men through him might believe.

 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world.

 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
knew him not.

 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on his name  Which were
born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God.

 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of
grace and truth.

 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom
I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was
before me.

 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ.

 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is
in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?   And he
confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am
not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer
to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?   He said, I am
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of
the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  
John answered them, saying, I baptize with water but there standeth
one among you, whom ye know not;  He it is, who coming after me is
preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
baptizing.

 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
preferred before me for he was before me.

 And I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to
Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

 And I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water,
the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending,
and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost.

 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
God!   And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
Jesus.

 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,
What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being
interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?   He saith unto them,
Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him
that day for it was about the tenth hour.

 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,
Thou art Simon the son of Jona thou shalt be called Cephas, which is
by interpretation, A stone.

 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,
of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of
Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!   Nathanael saith unto him,
Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that
Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of
God; thou art the King of Israel.

 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw
thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things
than these.

 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man.

 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
mother of Jesus was there  And both Jesus was called, and his
disciples, to the marriage.

 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine.

 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come.

 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,
do it.

 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.

 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
of the feast. And they bare it.

 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants which drew the
water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,  And
saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;
and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse but thou hast
kept the good wine until now.

 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples and they continued there not many days.

 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.

 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
and the changers of money sitting  And when he had made a scourge
of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep,
and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the
tables;  And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things
hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
thine house hath eaten me up.

 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?   Jesus answered and
said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.

 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?   But he spake
of the temple of his body.

 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the
scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,
many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
men,  And needed not that any should testify of man for he knew
what was in man.

 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi,
we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these
miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?  
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
of the Spirit is spirit.

 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth so
is every one that is born of the Spirit.

 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
and knowest not these things?   Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye
receive not our witness.

 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?   And no man hath
ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son
of man which is in heaven.

 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up  That whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have eternal life.

 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.

 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
that the world through him might be saved.

 He that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God.

 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
evil.

 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there
was much water there and they came, and were baptized.

 For John was not yet cast into prison.

 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and
the Jews about purifying.

 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same
baptizeth, and all men come to him.

 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be
given him from heaven.

 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,
but that I am sent before him.

 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the
bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because
of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

 He must increase, but I must decrease.

 He that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth
is earthly, and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is
above all.

 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
receiveth his testimony.

 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God
is true.

 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
hand.

 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life and he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
on him.

 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,  (Though Jesus
himself baptized not, but his disciples,)  He left Judaea, and
departed again into Galilee.

 And he must needs go through Samaria.

 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
his journey, sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour.

 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto
her, Give me to drink.

 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a
Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews
have no dealings with the Samaritans.

 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest
have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water?
 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,
and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I
shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him
shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
not, neither come hither to draw.

 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto
her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband  For thou hast had
five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that
saidst thou truly.

 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet.

 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
Father.

 Ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for
salvation is of the Jews.

 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in spirit and in truth for the Father seeketh such
to worship him.

 God is a Spirit and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.

 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
called Christ when he is come, he will tell us all things.

 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
with the woman yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest
thou with her?   The woman then left her waterpot, and went her
way into the city, and saith to the men,  Come, see a man, which
told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ?   Then
they went out of the city, and came unto him.

 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought
him ought to eat?   Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the
will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for
they are white already to harvest.

 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together.

 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men
laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that
he would tarry with them and he abode there two days.

 And many more believed because of his own word;  And said
unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying for we have
heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
Saviour of the world.

 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his
own country.

 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast for
they also went unto the feast.

 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water
wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at
Capernaum.

 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his
son for he was at the point of death.

 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
will not believe.

 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,
saying, Thy son liveth.

 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth and himself believed, and his
whole house.

 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come
out of Judaea into Galilee.

 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.

 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the
water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
eight years.

 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?   The
impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is
troubled, to put me into the pool but while I am coming, another
steppeth down before me.

 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
walked and on the same day was the sabbath.

 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
Take up thy bed, and walk.

 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take
up thy bed, and walk?   And he that was healed wist not who it
was for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that
place.

 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
Behold, thou art made whole sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto
thee.

 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had
made him whole.

 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,
making himself equal with God.

 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
Father do for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise.

 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye
may marvel.

 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son  That all men should honour the Son, even as they
honour the Father.

He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent
him.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that
hear shall live.

 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the
Son to have life in himself;  And hath given him authority to
execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming, in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear his voice,  And shall come forth;
they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

 I can of mine own self do nothing as I hear, I judge and my
judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of
the Father which hath sent me.

 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

 But I receive not testimony from man but these things I say,
that ye might be saved.

 He was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a
season to rejoice in his light.

 But I have greater witness than that of John for the works which
the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear
witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of
me.

Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

 And ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent,
him ye believe not.

 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life
and they are they which testify of me.

 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

 I receive not honour from men.

 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not if another
shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek
not the honour that cometh from God only?   Do not think that I
will accuse you to the Father there is one that accuseth you, even
Moses, in whom ye trust.

 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he
wrote of me.

 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my
words?   After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee,
which is the sea of Tiberias.

 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
which he did on them that were diseased.

 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
disciples.

 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come
unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these
may eat?   And this he said to prove him for he himself knew what
he would do.

 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto
him,  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
small fishes but what are they among so many?   And Jesus said,
Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the
men sat down, in number about five thousand.

 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set
down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and
above unto them that had eaten.

 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.

 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain
himself alone.

 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.

 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship and
they were afraid.

 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.

 Then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately
the ship was at the land whither they went.

 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side
of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his
disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks) 
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for
Jesus.

 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?   Jesus answered
them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because
ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were
filled.

 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
you for him hath God the Father sealed.

 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?   Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the
work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that
we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?   Our fathers
did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from
heaven to eat.

 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven.

 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
giveth life unto the world.

 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life he that cometh
to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
thirst.

 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.

 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.

 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all
which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up
again at the last day.

 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life and I
will raise him up at the last day.

 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
which came down from heaven.

 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from
heaven?   Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not
among yourselves.

 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
him and I will raise him up at the last day.

 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
God.

Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father,
cometh unto me.

 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,
he hath seen the Father.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life.

 I am that bread of life.

 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
eat thereof, and not die.

 I am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat
of this bread, he shall live for ever and the bread that I will give
is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
man give us his flesh to eat?   Then Jesus said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and
drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life;
and I will raise him up at the last day.

 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
and I in him.

 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father so
he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

 This is that bread which came down from heaven not as your
fathers did eat manna, and are dead he that eateth of this bread
shall live for ever.

 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said,
This is an hard saying; who can hear it?   When Jesus knew in
himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth
this offend you?   What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend
up where he was before?   It is the spirit that quickeneth; the
flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you, they are
spirit, and they are life.

 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from
the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray
him.

 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto
me, except it were given unto him of my Father.

 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
more with him.

 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?   Then
Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the
words of eternal life.

 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of
the living God.

 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
is a devil?   He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he
it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.

 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk
in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.

 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself
seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to
the world.

 For neither did his brethren believe in him.

 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come but your time
is alway ready.

 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of
it, that the works thereof are evil.

 Go ye up unto this feast I go not up yet unto this feast for my
time is not yet full come.

 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for
some said, He is a good man others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the
people.

 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,
and taught.

 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned?   Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine
is not mine, but his that sent me.

 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that
seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
unrighteousness is in him.

 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
law?  Why go ye about to kill me?   The people answered and said,
Thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee?   Jesus answered
and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of
Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a
man.

 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath day?   Judge not according to
the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
seek to kill?   But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing
unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
 Howbeit we know this man whence he is but when Christ cometh, no
man knoweth whence he is.

 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am and I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, whom ye know not.

 But I know him for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

 Then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him,
because his hour was not yet come.

 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers
to take him.

 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
then I go unto him that sent me.

 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me and where I am, thither
ye cannot come.

 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we
shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,
and teach the Gentiles?   What manner of saying is this that he
said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me and where I am, thither
ye cannot come?   In the last day, that great day of the feast,
Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto
me, and drink.

 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water.

 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that
Jesus was not yet glorified.)   Many of the people therefore, when
they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come
out of Galilee?   Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh
of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David
was?   So there was a division among the people because of him.

 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on
him.

 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?   The officers
answered, Never man spake like this man.

 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?   But
this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being
one of them,)  Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and
know what he doeth?   They answered and said unto him, Art thou
also of Galilee?  Search, and look for out of Galilee ariseth no
prophet.

 And every man went unto his own house.

 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all
the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,  They say unto
him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned but
what sayest thou?   This they said, tempting him, that they might
have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote
on the ground, as though he heard them not.

 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
stone at her.

 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last and
Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he
said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man
condemned thee?   She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,
Neither do I condemn thee go, and sin no more.

 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life.

 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true.

 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
myself, yet my record is true for I know whence I came, and whither I
go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true for I am not alone, but
I and the Father that sent me.

 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is
true.

 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
beareth witness of me.

 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
neither know me, nor my Father if ye had known me, ye should have
known my Father also.

 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
temple and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek
me, and shall die in your sins whither I go, ye cannot come.

 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
Whither I go, ye cannot come.

 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above ye
are of this world; I am not of this world.

 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins for if
ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

 I have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent
me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard
of him.

 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,
then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but
as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

 And he that sent me is with me the Father hath not left me
alone; for I do always those things that please him.

 As he spake these words, many believed on him.

 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;  And ye
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in
bondage to any man how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin.

 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the Son
abideth ever.

 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed.

 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,
because my word hath no place in you.

 I speak that which I have seen with my Father and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father.

 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus
saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works
of Abraham.

 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,
which I have heard of God this did not Abraham.

 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not
born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me
for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but
he sent me.

 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear
my word.

 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye
will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he
speaketh of his own for he is a liar, and the father of it.

 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
ye not believe me?   He that is of God heareth God's words ye
therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.

 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?   Jesus answered, I have
not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

 And I seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and
judgeth.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
never see death.

 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.

Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my
saying, he shall never taste of death.

 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself?   Jesus answered, If
I honour myself, my honour is nothing it is my Father that honoureth
me; of whom ye say, that he is your God  Yet ye have not known
him; but I know him and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a
liar like unto you but I know him, and keep his saying.

 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it, and
was glad.

 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,
and hast thou seen Abraham?   Jesus said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

 Then took they up stones to cast at him but Jesus hid himself,
and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so
passed by.

 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
birth.

 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
man, or his parents, that he was born blind?   Jesus answered,
Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents but that the works of
God should be made manifest in him.

 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day the
night cometh, when no man can work.

 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by
interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came
seeing.

 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that
he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?   Some
said, This is he others said, He is like him but he said, I am he.

 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and
anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and
wash and I went and washed, and I received sight.

 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
his eyes.

 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed,
and do see.

 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among
them.

 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that
he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight.

 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
born blind? how then doth he now see?   His parents answered them
and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind
 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
his eyes, we know not he is of age; ask him he shall speak for
himself.

 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews for
the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was
Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
Give God the praise we know that this man is a sinner.

 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not
one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he
thine eyes?   He answered them, I have told you already, and ye
did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his
disciples?   Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his
disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.

 We know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow, we know
not from whence he is.

 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine
eyes.

 Now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a
worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind.

 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.

 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in
sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?   He
answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that
talketh with thee.

 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,
and said unto him, Are we blind also?   Jesus said unto them, If
ye were blind, ye should have no sin but now ye say, We see;
therefore your sin remaineth.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber.

 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
and the sheep follow him for they know his voice.

 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him for
they know not the voice of strangers.

 This parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what
things they were which he spake unto them.

 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
I am the door of the sheep.

 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the
sheep did not hear them.

 I am the door by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
shall go in and out, and find pasture.

 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy I am come that they might have life, and that they might have
it more abundantly.

 I am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep.

 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
fleeth and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
for the sheep.

 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.

 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father and I lay
down my life for the sheep.

 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold them also I
must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,
and one shepherd.

 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
that I might take it again.

 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
commandment have I received of my Father.

 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
sayings.

 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye
him?   Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a
devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?   And it was at
Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long
dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not the works
that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
unto you.

 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me
 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

 I and my Father are one.

 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?   The Jews
answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for
blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
are gods?   If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God
came, and the scripture cannot be broken;  Say ye of him, whom
the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest;
because I said, I am the Son of God?   If I do not the works of
my Father, believe me not.

 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works that
ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

 Therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of
their hand,  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place
where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle but
all things that John spake of this man were true.

 And many believed on him there.

 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town
of Mary and her sister Martha.

 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)  
Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom
thou lovest is sick.

 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
thereby.

 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
still in the same place where he was.

 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
again.

 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither again?   Jesus answered, Are
there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he
stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
no light in him.

 These things said he and after that he saith unto them, Our
friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent
ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his
fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
four days already.

 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off
 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.

 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
and met him but Mary sat still in the house.

 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.

 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
will give it thee.

 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day.

 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life he
that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live 
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest
thou this?   She saith unto him, Yea, Lord I believe that thou
art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her
sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.

 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place
where Martha met him.

 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,
followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.

 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.

 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.

 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come
and see.

 Jesus wept.

 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!   And some of
them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind,
have caused that even this man should not have died?   Jesus
therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a
cave, and a stone lay upon it.

 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh for he
hath been dead four days.

 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?   Then
they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou
hast heard me.

 And I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the
people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast
sent me.

 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
Lazarus, come forth.

 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith
unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on him.

 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what things Jesus had done.

 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him and the
Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.

 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same
year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  Nor consider that
it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and
that the whole nation perish not.

 And this spake he not of himself but being high priest that
year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;  And
not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in
one the children of God that were scattered abroad.

 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
him to death.

 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand and many went out of
the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.

 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the
feast?   Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it,
that they might take him.

 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

 There they made him a supper; and Martha served but Lazarus was
one of them that sat at the table with him.

 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair and the
house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
which should betray him,  Why was not this ointment sold for three
hundred pence, and given to the poor?   This he said, not that he
cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and
bare what was put therein.

 Then said Jesus, Let her alone against the day of my burying
hath she kept this.

 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and
they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus
also, whom he had raised from the dead.

 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also
to death;  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went
away, and believed on Jesus.

 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  Took branches of
palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna Blessed is
the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
written,  Fear not, daughter of Sion behold, thy King cometh,
sitting on an ass's colt.

 These things understood not his disciples at the first but when
Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were
written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.

 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that
he had done this miracle.

 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
at the feast  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of
Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see
Jesus.

 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip
tell Jesus.

 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
of man should be glorified.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die, it abideth alone but if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit.

 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
shall also my servant be if any man serve me, him will my Father
honour.

 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour.

 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
thundered others said, An angel spake to him.

 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but
for your sakes.

 Now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this
world be cast out.

 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
me.

 This he said, signifying what death he should die.

 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
Christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be
lifted up? who is this Son of man?   Then Jesus said unto them,
Yet a little while is the light with you.

Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you for he that
walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did
hide himself from them.

 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
believed not on him  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might
be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and
to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?   Therefore they
could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  He hath
blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see
with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted,
and I should heal them.

 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
him.

 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they
should be put out of the synagogue  For they loved the praise of
men more than the praise of God.

 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
me, but on him that sent me.

 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
should not abide in darkness.

 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
judgeth him the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
the last day.

 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever
I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,
having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the
end.

 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;  Jesus knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come
from God, and went to God;  He riseth from supper, and laid aside
his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.

 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the
disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
girded.

 Then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
dost thou wash my feet?   Jesus answered and said unto him, What I
do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.

 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
hands and my head.

 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
his feet, but is clean every whit and ye are clean, but not all.

 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not
all clean.

 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to
you?   Ye call me Master and Lord and ye say well; for so I am.

 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
ought to wash one another's feet.

 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
done to you.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than
his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.

 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

 I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen but that the
scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted
up his heel against me.

 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye
may believe that I am he.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent
me.

 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you
shall betray me.

 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
spake.

 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved.

 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake.

 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon.

 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
him, That thou doest, do quickly.

 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto
him.

 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

 He then having received the sop went immediately out and it was
night.

 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek
me and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now
I say to you.

 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as
I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
love one to another.

 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow me afterwards.

 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will
lay down my life for thy sake.

 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou
hast denied me thrice.

 Let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God, believe also
in me.

 In my Father's house are many mansions if it were not so, I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and
how can we know the way?   Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the
truth, and the life no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also and from
henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
us.

 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet
hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the
Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?   Believest
thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words
that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the Father that
dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me or
else believe me for the very works' sake.

 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall
he do; because I go unto my Father.

 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son.

 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

 If ye love me, keep my commandments.

 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  Even the Spirit
of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not,
neither knoweth him but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and
shall be in you.

 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you.

 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
me because I live, ye shall live also.

 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,
and I in you.

 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I
will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?   Jesus
answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words
and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
abode with him.

 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which
ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.

 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you not as the
world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.

 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto
the Father for my Father is greater than I.

 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is
come to pass, ye might believe.

 Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this
world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and
every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring
forth more fruit.

 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
in me.

 I am the vine, ye are the branches He that abideth in me, and I
in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do
nothing.

 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
are burned.

 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what
ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall
ye be my disciples.

 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you continue ye in
my love.

 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in
you, and that your joy might be full.

 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
loved you.

 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friends.

 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth but I have called you friends; for all things
that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should
remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may
give it you.

 These things I command you, that ye love one another.

 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
you.

 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own but
because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
world, therefore the world hateth you.

 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.

 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,
because they know not him that sent me.

 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin
but now they have no cloak for their sin.

 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,
they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me
and my Father.

 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that
is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the
Father, he shall testify of me  And ye also shall bear witness,
because ye have been with me from the beginning.

 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended.

 They shall put you out of the synagogues yea, the time cometh,
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
known the Father, nor me.

 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not
unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
me, Whither goest thou?   But because I have said these things
unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
go away for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment  Of sin, because they believe not
on me;  Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see
me no more;  Of judgment, because the prince of this world is
judged.

 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.

 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come.

 He shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine, and shall
shew it unto you.

 All things that the Father hath are mine therefore said I, that
he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

 A little while, and ye shall not see me and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me and
again, a little while, and ye shall see me and, Because I go to the
Father?   They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A
little while? we cannot tell what he saith.

 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while,
and ye shall not see me and again, a little while, and ye shall see
me?   Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and
lament, but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful, but
your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
come but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no
more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

 And ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give
it you.

 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask, and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full.

 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs but the time
cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall
shew you plainly of the Father.

 At that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you,
that I will pray the Father for you  For the Father himself
loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came
out from God.

 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world again,
I leave the world, and go to the Father.

 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb.

 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest
forth from God.

 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?   Behold, the hour
cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his
own, and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone, because the
Father is with me.

 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
peace.

In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world.

 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee  As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that
he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

 I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do.

 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the
glory which I had with thee before the world was.

 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have
kept thy word.

 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
are of thee.

 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and
they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from
thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

 I pray for them I pray not for the world, but for them which
thou hast given me; for they are thine.

 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
in them.

 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those
whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name
those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but
the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

 Sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth.

 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world.

 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
sanctified through the truth.

 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word;  That they all may be one; as
thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in
us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they
may be one, even as we are one  I in them, and thou in me, that
they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given
me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee but I have
known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
them.

 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he
entered, and his disciples.

 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place for Jesus
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the
chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons.

 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?   They answered him,
Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he.

And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
backward, and fell to the ground.

 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
Nazareth.

 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he if therefore ye
seek me, let these go their way  That the saying might be
fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost
none.

 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was
Malchus.

 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath
the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and
bound him,  And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in
law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
expedient that one man should die for the people.

 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple
that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus
into the palace of the high priest.

 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her
that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.

 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire
of coals; for it was cold and they warmed themselves and Peter stood
with them, and warmed himself.

 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
doctrine.

 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort;
and in secret have I said nothing.

 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
unto them behold, they know what I said.

 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the
high priest so?   Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear
witness of the evil but if well, why smitest thou me?   Now
Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.

 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and
said, I am not.

 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose
ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
 Peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew.

 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and
it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall,
lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.

 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring
ye against this man?   They answered and said unto him, If he
were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.

 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according
to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us
to put any man to death  That the saying of Jesus might be
fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.

 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?   Jesus
answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it
thee of me?   Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done?
 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom
were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence.

 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and
for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto
the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,
he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no
fault at all.

 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
passover will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the
Jews?   Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but
Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.

 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
head, and they put on him a purple robe,  And said, Hail, King of
the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.

 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I
bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.

 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!   When
the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out,
saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him,
and crucify him for I find no fault in him.

 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to
die, because he made himself the Son of God.

 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release
thee?   Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all
against me, except it were given thee from above therefore he that
delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.

 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him but the Jews
cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's
friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.

 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the
Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth
hour and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!   But they
cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.

Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests
answered, We have no king but Caesar.

 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
they took Jesus, and led him away.

 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha  Where
they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and
Jesus in the midst.

 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 This title then read many of the Jews for the place where Jesus
was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in Hebrew, and
Greek, and Latin.

 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his
coat now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
cast lots for it, whose it shall be that the scripture might be
fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my
vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.

 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that
hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a
spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.

 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
finished and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that
sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away.

 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of
the other which was crucified with him.

 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
they brake not his legs  But one of the soldiers with a spear
pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.

 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true and he
knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

 For these things were done, that the scripture should be
fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
they pierced.

 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,
but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take
away the body of Jesus and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore,
and took the body of Jesus.

 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus
by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred
pound weight.

 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and
in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation
day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre.

 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away
the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid
him.

 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to
the sepulchre.

 So they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun
Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
lying; yet went he not in.

 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,  And the napkin, that
was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped
together in a place by itself.

 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again
from the dead.

 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she
wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,  And seeth
two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the
feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto
them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they
have laid him.

 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if
thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I
will take him away.

 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
my Father but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them,
Peace be unto you.

 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his
side.

Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.

 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you as my Father
hath sent me, even so send I you.

 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost  Whose soever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are
retained.

 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
when Jesus came.

 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
LORD.

But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of
the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust
my hand into his side, I will not believe.

 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
with them then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the
midst, and said, Peace be unto you.

 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side and be
not faithless, but believing.

 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.

 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
hast believed blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed.

 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
disciples, which are not written in this book  But these are
written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at
the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.

 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other
of his disciples.

 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,
We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship
immediately; and that night they caught nothing.

 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore but
the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
answered him, No.

 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not
able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is
the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his
fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into
the sea.

 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not
far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net
with fishes.

 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
caught.

 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
fishes, an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so
many, yet was not the net broken.

 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
likewise.

 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,
Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love
thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,
Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things;
thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou
shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall
gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.

 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord,
which is he that betrayeth thee?   Peter seeing him saith to
Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?   Jesus saith unto him,
If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou
me.

 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
disciple should not die yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not
die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
these things and we know that his testimony is true.

 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,
if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world
itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.




The Acts of the Apostles


 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
began both to do and teach,  Until the day in which he was taken
up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto
the apostles whom he had chosen  To whom also he shewed himself
alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them
forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of
God  And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that
they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the
Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.

 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,
Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?  
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the
seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all
Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;  Which also said,
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and
Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.

 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and
twenty,)  Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before
concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.

 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
ministry.

 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels
gushed out.

 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as
that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say,
The field of blood.

 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
desolate, and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another
take.

 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time
that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,  Beginning from the
baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must
one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.

 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias.

 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts
of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,  That he
may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by
transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.

 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one place.

 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.

 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.

 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
language.

 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?   And how hear we
every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?   Parthians, and
Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea,
and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in
Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
Jews and proselytes,  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak
in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
another, What meaneth this?   Others mocking said, These men are
full of new wine.

 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem,
be this known unto you, and hearken to my words  For these are
not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the
day.

 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  And
it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of
my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams  And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will
pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy  And
I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath;
blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke  The sun shall be turned
into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable
day of the Lord come  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever
shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God
did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know  Him,
being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,
ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain  Whom
God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death because it was
not possible that he should be holden of it.

 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be
moved  Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope  Because thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption.

 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance.

 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us
unto this day.

 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,
he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  He seeing this
before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left
in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.

 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed
forth this, which ye now see and hear.

 For David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself,
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  Until I
make thy foes thy footstool.

 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
Christ.

 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren,
what shall we do?   Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.

 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save
yourselves from this untoward generation.

 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the
same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.

 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

 And fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were
done by the apostles.

 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,
as every man had need.

 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness
and singleness of heart,  Praising God, and having favour with all
the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be
saved.

 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
prayer, being the ninth hour.

 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom
they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful,
to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;  Who seeing Peter
and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.

 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on
us.

 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
them.

 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
give I thee In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.

 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up and
immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into
the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

 And all the people saw him walking and praising God  And they
knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the
temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which
had happened unto him.

 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the
people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's,
greatly wondering.

 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and
denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let
him go.

 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you;  And killed the Prince of life, whom God
hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.

 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,
whom ye see and know yea, the faith which is by him hath given him
this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did
also your rulers.

 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all
his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
of the Lord.

 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
you  Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began.

 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.

 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear
that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.

 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall
all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of
the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,  Being grieved that
they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection
from the dead.

 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
day for it was now eventide.

 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number
of the men was about five thousand.

 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders,
and scribes,  And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John,
and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest,
were gathered together at Jerusalem.

 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
power, or by what name, have ye done this?   Then Peter, filled
with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and
elders of Israel,  If we this day be examined of the good deed done
to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  Be it known
unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the
dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
is become the head of the corner.

 Neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other
name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they
took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they
could say nothing against it.

 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
they conferred among themselves,  Saying, What shall we do to
these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
teach in the name of Jesus.

 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,
judge ye.

 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people for
all men glorified God for that which was done.

 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
healing was shewed.

 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with
one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and
earth, and the sea, and all that in them is  Who by the mouth of
thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people
imagine vain things?   The kings of the earth stood up, and the
rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his
Christ.

 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the
people of Israel, were gathered together,  For to do whatsoever
thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.

 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and grant unto thy
servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,  By
stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be
done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
they spake the word of God with boldness.

 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of
one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common.

 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all.

 Neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the
things that were sold,  And laid them down at the apostles' feet
and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.

 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,
being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the
country of Cyprus,  Having land, sold it, and brought the money,
and laid it at the apostles' feet.

 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession,  And kept back part of the price, his wife also being
privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles'
feet.

 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in
thine heart?  thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost
and great fear came on all them that heard these things.

 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and
buried him.

 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,
not knowing what was done, came in.

 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for
so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.

 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have
buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.

 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
ghost and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying
her forth, buried her by her husband.

 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
heard these things.

 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in
Solomon's porch.

 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people
magnified them.

 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
men and women.)   Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into
the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the
shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean
spirits and they were healed every one.

 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
(which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
indignation,  And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them
in the common prison.

 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
brought them forth, and said,  Go, stand and speak in the temple
to the people all the words of this life.

 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in
the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were
with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the
children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
they returned and told,  Saying, The prison truly found we shut
with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors
but when we had opened, we found no man within.

 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this
would grow.

 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put
in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without
violence for they feared the people, lest they should have been
stoned.

 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council
and the high priest asked them,  Saying, Did not we straitly
command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye
have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this
man's blood upon us.

 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to
obey God rather than men.

 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
on a tree.

 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy
Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
counsel to slay them.

 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people,
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;  And said
unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to
do as touching these men.

 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
themselves who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
scattered, and brought to nought.

 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
taxing, and drew away much people after him he also perished; and
all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
alone for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to
nought  But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply
ye be found even to fight against God.

 And to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles,
and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name
of Jesus, and let them go.

 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
teach and preach Jesus Christ.

 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the
Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily
ministration.

 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,
and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and
serve tables.

 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over
this business.

 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
ministry of the word.

 And the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and
Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a
proselyte of Antioch  Whom they set before the apostles and when
they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests
were obedient to the faith.

 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
miracles among the people.

 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of
them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
which he spake.

 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.

 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,
 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to
speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law  For
we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.

 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw
his face as it had been the face of an angel.

 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?   And he said,
Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto
our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in
Charran,  And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
Charran and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him
into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a
possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.

 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and
entreat them evil four hundred years.

 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said
God and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.

 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat
Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and
Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.

 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt but
God was with him,  And delivered him out of all his afflictions,
and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance.

 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
our fathers first.

 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that
Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of
Sychem.

 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn
to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,  Till another
king arose, which knew not Joseph.

 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our
fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they
might not live.

 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
nourished up in his father's house three months  And when he was
cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her
own son.

 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was
mighty in words and in deeds.

 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to
visit his brethren the children of Israel.

 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian  For he supposed
his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would
deliver them but they understood not.

 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and
would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why
do ye wrong one to another?   But he that did his neighbour wrong
thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?  
Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of
Madian, where he begat two sons.

 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
bush.

 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight and as he drew near
to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,  Saying, I am
the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.

 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet for
the place where thou standest is holy ground.

 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver
them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand
of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.

 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs
in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty
years.

 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,
like unto me; him shall ye hear.

 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers who
received the lively oracles to give unto us  To whom our fathers
would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned
back again into Egypt,  Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go
before us for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel,
have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of
forty years in the wilderness?   Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of
Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to
worship them and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.

 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as
he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it
according to the fashion that he had seen.

 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into
the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of
our fathers, unto the days of David;  Who found favour before God,
and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.

 But Solomon built him an house.

 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as
saith the prophet,  Heaven is my throne, and earth is my
footstool what house will ye build me? saith the Lord or what is the
place of my rest?   Hath not my hand made all these things?  
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did, so do ye.

 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they
have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of
whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers  Who have
received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.

 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
they gnashed on him with their teeth.

 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand
of God,  And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son
of man standing on the right hand of God.

 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
and ran upon him with one accord,  And cast him out of the city,
and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young
man's feet, whose name was Saul.

 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit.

 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not
this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was
a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and
they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and
Samaria, except the apostles.

 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
lamentation over him.

 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
preaching the word.

 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.

 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
were possessed with them and many taken with palsies, and that were
lame, were healed.

 And there was great joy in that city.

 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving
out that himself was some great one  To whom they all gave heed,
from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of
God.

 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries.

 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both
men and women.

 Then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized, he
continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs
which were done.

 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John 
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
receive the Holy Ghost  (For as yet he was fallen upon none of
them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands
the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  Saying, Give me
also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the
Holy Ghost.

 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is
not right in the sight of God.

 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps
the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
the bond of iniquity.

 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that
none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages
of the Samaritans.

 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza, which is desert.

 And he arose and went and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch
of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet.

 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
this chariot.

 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?   And he
said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired
Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth  In his humiliation his judgment was
taken away and who shall declare his generation? for his life is
taken from the earth.

 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and
preached unto him Jesus.

 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water
and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be
baptized?   And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine
heart, thou mayest.

And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God.

 And he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down
both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more and he went
on his way rejoicing.

 But Philip was found at Azotus and passing through he preached
in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,  And desired of
him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of
this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound
unto Jerusalem.

 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus and suddenly there
shined round about him a light from heaven  And he fell to the
earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?   And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am
Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the
pricks.

 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me
to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do.

 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
voice, but seeing no man.

 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he
saw no man but they led him by the hand, and brought him into
Damascus.

 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
drink.

 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and
to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am
here, Lord.

 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which
is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called
Saul, of Tarsus for, behold, he prayeth,  And hath seen in a
vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him,
that he might receive his sight.

 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem  And here
he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy
name.

 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
children of Israel  For I will shew him how great things he must
suffer for my name's sake.

 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting
his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that
appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales
and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.

 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul
certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.

 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is
the Son of God.

 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that
destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither
for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief
priests?   But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded
the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.

 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
kill him  But their laying await was known of Saul. And they
watched the gates day and night to kill him.

 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
wall in a basket.

 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
to the disciples but they were all afraid of him, and believed not
that he was a disciple.

 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he
had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the
name of Jesus.

 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
against the Grecians but they went about to slay him.

 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea,
and sent him forth to Tarsus.

 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and
Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in
the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he
came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his
bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole
arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
Lord.

 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did.

 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died
whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.

 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him
that he would not delay to come to them.

 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him
weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while
she was with them.

 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and
turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes
and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the
Lord.

 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
Simon a tanner.

 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion
of the band called the Italian band,  A devout man, and one that
feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and
prayed to God alway.

 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an
angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.

 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it,
Lord?  And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up
for a memorial before God.

 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname
is Peter  He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by
the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them
that waited on him continually;  And when he had declared all
these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.

 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto
the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth
hour  And he became very hungry, and would have eaten but while
they made ready, he fell into a trance,  And saw heaven opened,
and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet
knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth  Wherein
were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts,
and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
that is common or unclean.

 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

 This was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into
heaven.

 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had
seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had
made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,  And
called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged
there.

 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
Behold, three men seek thee.

 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
nothing for I have sent them.

 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek what is the cause
wherefore ye are come?   And they said, Cornelius the centurion,
a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the
nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for
thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.

 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter
went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near
friends.

 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at
his feet, and worshipped him.

 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.

 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were
come together.

 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing
for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another
nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common
or unclean.

 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
sent for I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?  
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and
at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood
before me in bright clothing,  And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is
heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.

 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea
side who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God,
to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
that God is no respecter of persons  But in every nation he that
feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.

 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)  That word, I say, ye
know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from
Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  How God anointed
Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about
doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God
was with him.

 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land
of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree
 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 
Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to
us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.

 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and
dead.

 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
them which heard the word.

 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as
many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured
out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
answered Peter,  Can any man forbid water, that these should not
be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then
prayed they him to tarry certain days.

 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
Gentiles had also received the word of God.

 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
circumcision contended with him,  Saying, Thou wentest in to men
uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.

 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
it by order unto them, saying,  I was in the city of Joppa
praying and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as
it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and
it came even to me  Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes,
I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts,
and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.

 But I said, Not so, Lord for nothing common or unclean hath at
any time entered into my mouth.

 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
cleansed, that call not thou common.

 And this was done three times and all were drawn up again into
heaven.

 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto
the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's
house  And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house,
which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,
whose surname is Peter;  Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou
and all thy house shall be saved.

 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
at the beginning.

 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost.

 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,
who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could
withstand God?   When they heard these things, they held their
peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles
granted repentance unto life.

 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and
Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.

 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they
were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD
Jesus.

 And the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number
believed, and turned unto the Lord.

 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should
go as far as Antioch.

 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto
the Lord.

 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith
and much people was added unto the Lord.

 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul  And
when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to
pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and
taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in
Antioch.

 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world
which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea
 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
Barnabas and Saul.

 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
vex certain of the church.

 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)   And
when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him
to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to
bring him forth to the people.

 Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without
ceasing of the church unto God for him.

 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter
was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains and the
keepers before the door kept the prison.

 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
shined in the prison and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him
up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
sandals.

And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and
follow me.

 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of
his own accord and they went out, and passed on through one street;
and forthwith the angel departed from him.

 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out
of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of
the Jews.

 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were
gathered together praying.

 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
hearken, named Rhoda.

 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.

 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

 But Peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door,
and saw him, they were astonished.

 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And
he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he
departed, and went into another place.

 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
soldiers, what was become of Peter.

 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.
And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.

 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon but
they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's
chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was
nourished by the king's country.

 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
throne, and made an oration unto them.

 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
and not of a man.

 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
not God the glory and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was
Mark.

 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and
Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the
tetrarch, and Saul.

 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
them.

 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
them, they sent them away.

 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in
the synagogues of the Jews and they had also John to their minister.

 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus
 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the
word of God.

 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost,
set his eyes on him.

 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of
the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to
pervert the right ways of the Lord?   And now, behold, the hand
of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun
for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness;
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
Perga in Pamphylia and John departing from them returned to
Jerusalem.

 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.

 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have
any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted
the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with
an high arm brought he them out of it.

 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
the wilderness.

 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
he divided their land to them by lot.

 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

 And afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul
the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty
years.

 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be
their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have
found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall
fulfil all my will.

 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
Israel a Saviour, Jesus  When John had first preached before his
coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I
am?  I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes
of his feet I am not worthy to loose.

 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation
sent.

 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every
sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.

 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
Pilate that he should be slain.

 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

 But God raised him from the dead  And he was seen many
days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are
his witnesses unto the people.

 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which
was made unto the fathers,  God hath fulfilled the same unto us
their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also
written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee.

 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you
the sure mercies of David.

 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption.

 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption
 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins  And by
him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye
could not be justified by the law of Moses.

 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in
the prophets;  Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish for
I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe,
though a man declare it unto you.

 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.

 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who, speaking to
them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
hear the word of God.

 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
contradicting and blaspheming.

 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing
ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be
a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the
ends of the earth.

 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed.

 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
region.

 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.

 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came
unto Iconium.

 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into
the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both
of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
minds evil affected against the brethren.

 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which
gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and
wonders to be done by their hands.

 But the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the
Jews, and part with the apostles.

 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also
of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone
them,  They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe,
cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about 
And there they preached the gospel.

 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked  The
same heard Paul speak who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving
that he had faith to be healed,  Said with a loud voice, Stand
upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.

 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men.

 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
he was the chief speaker.

 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with
the people.

 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent
their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,  And
saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions
with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities
unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
all things that are therein  Who in times past suffered all
nations to walk in their own ways.

 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did
good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness.

 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
they had not done sacrifice unto them.

 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the
city, supposing he had been dead.

 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and
came into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe.

 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and
Antioch,  Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting
them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much
tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
believed.

 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
Pamphylia.

 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
into Attalia  And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had
been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they
fulfilled.

 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened
the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

 And there they abode long time with the disciples.

 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,
and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye
cannot be saved.

 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and
elders about this question.

 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and
they caused great joy unto all the brethren.

 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the
church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things
that God had done with them.

 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to
command them to keep the law of Moses.

 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this
matter.

 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God
made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the
word of the gospel, and believe.

 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them
the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;  And put no difference
between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
we shall be saved, even as they.

 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought
among the Gentiles by them.

 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men
and brethren, hearken unto me  Simeon hath declared how God at
the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his
name.

 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of
David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof,
and I will set it up  That the residue of men might seek after
the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the
Lord, who doeth all these things.

 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
world.

 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
among the Gentiles are turned to God  But that we write unto
them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from
fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.

 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and
Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among
the brethren  And they wrote letters by them after this manner;
The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren
which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us
have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must
be circumcised, and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment
 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  Men that
have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you
the same things by mouth.

 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
no greater burden than these necessary things;  That ye abstain
from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves, ye
shall do well. Fare ye well.

 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch and when they
had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle 
Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.

 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
peace from the brethren unto the apostles.

 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and
visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of
the LORD, and see how they do.

 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
was Mark.

 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
asunder one from the other and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto
Cyprus;  And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by
the brethren unto the grace of God.

 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra and, behold, a certain disciple
was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a
Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek  Which was well
reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.

 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters for
they knew all that his father was a Greek.

 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders
which were at Jerusalem.

 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
in number daily.

 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
Asia,  After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
Bithynia but the Spirit suffered them not.

 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help
us.

 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to
go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for
to preach the gospel unto them.

 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;  And from thence to
Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a
colony and we were in that city abiding certain days.

 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the
women which resorted thither.

 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us whose heart the Lord
opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.

 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my
house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her
masters much gain by soothsaying  The same followed Paul and us,
and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God,
which shew unto us the way of salvation.

 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and
said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come
out of her.

And he came out the same hour.

 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,
they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto
the rulers,  And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These
men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,  And teach
customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe,
being Romans.

 And the multitude rose up together against them and the
magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.

 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely  Who,
having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and
made their feet fast in the stocks.

 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
God and the prisoners heard them.

 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors
were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.

 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have
killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm
for we are all here.

 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
and fell down before Paul and Silas,  And brought them out, and
said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?   And they said, Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
were in his house.

 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.

 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
Let those men go.

 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart, and go in
peace.

 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us
out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us
out.

 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and
they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
desired them to depart out of the city.

 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and
departed.

 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews  And
Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days
reasoned with them out of the scriptures,  Opening and alleging,
that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead;
and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.

 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and
of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a
few.

 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and
set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and
sought to bring them out to the people.

 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned
the world upside down are come hither also;  Whom Jason hath
received and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying
that there is another king, one Jesus.

 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
they heard these things.

 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they
let them go.

 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
unto Berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.

 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which
were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred
up the people.

 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
were to the sea but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens and
receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him
with all speed, they departed.

 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him.

 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.

 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?   For
thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know
therefore what these things mean.

 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new
thing.)   Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said,
Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
superstitious.

 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any
thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; 
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the
face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and
the bounds of their habitation;  That they should seek the Lord,
if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far
from every one of us  For in him we live, and move, and have our
being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also
his offspring.

 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man's device.

 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men every where to repent  Because he hath
appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness
by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance
unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.

 So Paul departed from among them.

 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed among the
which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and
others with them.

 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
Corinth;  And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus,
lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that
Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and came unto
them.

 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the
Jews and the Greeks.

 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was
Christ.

 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am
clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house,
named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the
synagogue.

 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed,
and were baptized.

 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace  For I am with thee,
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in
this city.

 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word
of God among them.

 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the
judgment seat,  Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God
contrary to the law.

 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews,
reason would that I should bear with you  But if it be a
question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I
will be no judge of such matters.

 And he drave them from the judgment seat.

 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for
none of those things.

 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with
him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea for he
had a vow.

 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there but he himself
entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
consented not;  But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all
means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I will return
again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the
church, he went down to Antioch.

 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening
all the disciples.

 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of
the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila
and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto
him the way of God more perfectly.

 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him who, when he was come,
helped them much which had believed through grace  For he
mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the
scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding
certain disciples,  He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy
Ghost since ye believed?  And they said unto him, We have not so much
as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.

 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
said, Unto John's baptism.

 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him
which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus.

 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

 And all the men were about twelve.

 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of God.

 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks.

 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul  So
that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons,
and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of
them.

 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus,
saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
priests, which did so.

 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
know; but who are ye?   And the man in whom the evil spirit was
leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that
they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified.

 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
deeds.

 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
together, and burned them before all men and they counted the price
of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when
he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,
saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.

 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.

 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.

 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and
said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much
people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands 
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but
also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised,
and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worshippeth.

 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and
cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

 And the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught
Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel,
they rushed with one accord into the theatre.

 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
disciples suffered him not.

 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the
theatre.

 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another for the
assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were
come together.

 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made
his defence unto the people.

 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men
of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of
the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the
image which fell down from Jupiter?   Seeing then that these
things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do
nothing rashly.

 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers
of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.

 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
deputies let them implead one another.

 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
be determined in a lawful assembly.

 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this
concourse.

 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.

 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
exhortation, he came into Greece,  And there abode three months.
And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into
Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.

 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and
Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

 These going before tarried for us at Troas.

 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven
days.

 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on
the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
gathered together.

 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
being fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was long preaching, he
sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken
up dead.

 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
departed.

 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
comforted.

 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
intending to take in Paul for so had he appointed, minding himself to
go afoot.

 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
Mitylene.

 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;
and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and
the next day we came to Miletus.

 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not
spend the time in Asia for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to
be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
the church.

 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from
the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been
with you at all seasons,  Serving the LORD with all humility of
mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the
lying in wait of the Jews  And how I kept back nothing that was
profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you
publickly, and from house to house,  Testifying both to the Jews,
and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our
Lord Jesus Christ.

 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
knowing the things that shall befall me there  Save that the
Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions
abide me.

 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the
ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the
gospel of the grace of God.

 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the
blood of all men.

 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
God.

 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over
the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church
of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
things, to draw away disciples after them.

 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years
I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance
among all them which are sanctified.

 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
my necessities, and to them that were with me.

 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he
said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
them all.

 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,
 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara  And finding a
ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.

 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre for there the ship was to
unlade her burden.

 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days who said to
Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till
we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.

 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and
they returned home again.

 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.

 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and
came unto Caesarea and we entered into the house of Philip the
evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.

 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.

 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a
certain prophet, named Agabus.

 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound
his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall
the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will
of the Lord be done.

 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
Jerusalem.

 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom
we should lodge.

 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
gladly.

 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
the elders were present.

 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which
believe; and they are all zealous of the law  And they are
informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the
Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise
their children, neither to walk after the customs.

 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together
for they will hear that thou art come.

 Do therefore this that we say to thee We have four men which
have a vow on them;  Them take, and purify thyself with them, and
be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads and all may
know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest
the law.

 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep
themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from
strangled, and from fornication.

 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with
them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the
days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for
every one of them.

 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people,
and laid hands on him,  Crying out, Men of Israel, help This is
the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the
law, and this place and further brought Greeks also into the temple,
and hath polluted this holy place.

 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together and
they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the
doors were shut.

 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left
beating of Paul.

 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he
had done.

 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude and
when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him
to be carried into the castle.

 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
with him.

 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
Greek?   Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days
madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand
men that were murderers?   But Paul said, I am a man which am a
Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city and, I
beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.

 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a
great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, 
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto
you.

 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,
they kept the more silence and he saith,)  I am verily a man
which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in
this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect
manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye
all are this day.

 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
into prisons both men and women.

 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
of the elders from whom also I received letters unto the brethren,
and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto
Jerusalem, for to be punished.

 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a
great light round about me.

 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?   And I answered, Who art
thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou
persecutest.

 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all
things which are appointed for thee to do.

 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led
by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.

 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,  Came unto me, and
stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same
hour I looked up upon him.

 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the
voice of his mouth.

 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
seen and heard.

 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;  And saw
him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem
for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every
synagogue them that believed on thee  And when the blood of thy
martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto
his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.

 And he said unto me, Depart for I will send thee far hence unto
the Gentiles.

 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth for it
is not fit that he should live.

 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
dust into the air,  The chief captain commanded him to be brought
into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging;
that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.

 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,
and uncondemned?   When the centurion heard that, he went and
told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest for this
man is a Roman.

 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this
freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
examined him and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew
that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands,
and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and
brought Paul down, and set him before them.

 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this
day.

 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth.

 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall
for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be
smitten contrary to the law?   And they that stood by said,
Revilest thou God's high priest?   Then said Paul, I wist not,
brethren, that he was the high priest for it is written, Thou shalt
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.

 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a
Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the
dead I am called in question.

 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
Pharisees and the Sadducees and the multitude was divided.

 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
angel, nor spirit but the Pharisees confess both.

 And there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the
Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this
man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight
against God.

 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded
the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and
to bring him into the castle.

 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
good cheer, Paul for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so
must thou bear witness also at Rome.

 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor
drink till they had killed Paul.

 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we
have slain Paul.

 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire
something more perfectly concerning him and we, or ever he come near,
are ready to kill him.

 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he
went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring
this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to
tell him.

 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said,
Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this
young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.

 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they
would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

 But do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him
of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath,
that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and
now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.

 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged
him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.

 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten,
and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;  And
provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe
unto Felix the governor.

 And he wrote a letter after this manner  Claudius Lysias
unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.

 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
them then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood
that he was a Roman.

 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
him, I brought him forth into their council  Whom I perceived to
be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his
charge worthy of death or of bonds.

 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,
I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also
to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.

 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
brought him by night to Antipatris.

 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
returned to the castle  Who, when they came to Caesarea and
delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.

 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; 
I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he
commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the
governor against Paul.

 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very
worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,  We
accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all
thankfulness.

 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray
thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.

 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of
the sect of the Nazarenes  Who also hath gone about to profane
the temple whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.

 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
violence took him away out of our hands,  Commanding his accusers
to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge
of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years
a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself
 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the
city  Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse
me.

 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call
heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which
are written in the law and in the prophets  And have hope toward
God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
void to offence toward God, and toward men.

 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
offerings.

 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had
ought against me.

 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
doing in me, while I stood before the council,  Except it be for
this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the
resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.

 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge
of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain
shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.

 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to
minister or come unto him.

 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the
faith in Christ.

 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I
have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and
communed with him.

 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room and
Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
against Paul, and besought him,  And desired favour against him,
that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to
kill him.

 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
that he himself would depart shortly thither.

 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought.

 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul,
which they could not prove.

 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I
offended any thing at all.

 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
things before me?   Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment
seat, where I ought to be judged to the Jews have I done no wrong, as
thou very well knowest.

 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
death, I refuse not to die but if there be none of these things
whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal
unto Caesar.

 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Caesarea to salute Festus.

 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's
cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by
Felix  About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests
and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment
against him.

 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the
accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself
concerning the crime laid against him.

 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the
morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought
forth.

 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
accusation of such things as I supposed  But had certain
questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus,
which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
matters.

 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.

 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief
captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul
was brought forth.

 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the
Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that
he ought not to live any longer.

 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to
send him.

 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore
I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king
Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.

 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
thyself.

Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself  I
think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself
this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of
the Jews  Especially because I know thee to be expert in all
customs and questions which are among the Jews wherefore I beseech
thee to hear me patiently.

 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;  Which knew me
from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most
straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
God, unto our fathers  Unto which promise our twelve tribes,
instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's
sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
should raise the dead?   I verily thought with myself, that I
ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the saints did
I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;
and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.

 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted
them even unto strange cities.

 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
from the chief priests,  At midday, O king, I saw in the way a
light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round
about me and them which journeyed with me.

 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
thou persecutest.

 But rise, and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee
for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these
things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will
appear unto thee;  Delivering thee from the people, and from the
Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,  To open their eyes, and to
turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among
them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision  But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the
Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet
for repentance.

 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill me.

 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than
those which the prophets and Moses did say should come  That
Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise
from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the
Gentiles.

 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.

 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness.

 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
freely for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.

 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.

 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am,
except these bonds.

 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they that sat with them  And when they were
gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth
nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a
centurion of Augustus' band.

 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to
sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of
Thessalonica, being with us.

 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh
himself.

 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
because the winds were contrary.

 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into
Italy; and he put us therein.

 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete,
over against Salmone;  And, hardly passing it, came unto a place
which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,  And
said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt
and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our
lives.

 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain
to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth
toward the south west and north west.

 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.

 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
called Euroclydon.

 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
wind, we let her drive.

 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
had much work to come by the boat  Which when they had taken up,
they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should
fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
they lightened the ship;  And the third day we cast out with our
own hands the tackling of the ship.

 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then
taken away.

 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them,
and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed
from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.

 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no
loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.

 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
and whom I serve,  Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought
before Caesar and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with
thee.

 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer for I believe God, that it
shall be even as it was told me.

 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near
to some country;  And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms and
when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it
fifteen fathoms.

 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they
had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would
have cast anchors out of the foreship,  Paul said to the
centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye
cannot be saved.

 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
fall off.

 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and
continued fasting, having taken nothing.

 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for this is for your
health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.

 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
God in presence of them all and when he had broken it, he began to
eat.

 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.

 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
sixteen souls.

 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
cast out the wheat into the sea.

 And when it was day, they knew not the land but they discovered
a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it
were possible, to thrust in the ship.

 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up
the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.

 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the
hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.

 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of
them should swim out, and escape.

 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast
themselves first into the sea, and get to land  And the rest,
some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.

And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
called Melita.

 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they
kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present
rain, and because of the cold.

 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on
the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his
hand.

 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,
they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom,
though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down
dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while, and saw no
harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a
god.

 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three
days courteously.

 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
fever and of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and
laid his hands on him, and healed him.

 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
island, came, and were healed  Who also honoured us with many
honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were
necessary.

 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium and
after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
Puteoli  Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with
them seven days and so we went toward Rome.

 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself
with a soldier that kept him.

 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief
of the Jews together and when they were come together, he said unto
them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the
people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from
Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
there was no cause of death in me.

 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and
to speak with you because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with
this chain.

 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed
or spake any harm of thee.

 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as
concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.

 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of
God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses,
and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.

 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
believed not.

 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after
that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the
prophet unto our fathers,  Saying, Go unto this people, and say,
Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall
see, and not perceive  For the heart of this people is waxed
gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they
closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their
ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I
should heal them.

 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.

 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
great reasoning among themselves.

 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
received all that came in unto him,  Preaching the kingdom of
God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,
with all confidence, no man forbidding him.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans


 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
separated unto the gospel of God,  (Which he had promised afore by
his prophets in the holy scriptures,)  Concerning his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the
flesh;  And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to
the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead  By whom
we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith
among all nations, for his name  Among whom are ye also the called
of Jesus Christ  To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to
be saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ.

 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers;  Making request, if by any means now at length I might
have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
gift, to the end ye may be established;  That is, that I may be
comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have
some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
the wise, and to the unwise.

 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at Rome also.

 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first,
and also to the Greek.

 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
faith as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness;  Because that which may be known of God is
manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even
his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse 
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and
their foolish heart was darkened.

 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  And
changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping
things.

 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Amen.

 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even
their women did change the natural use into that which is against
nature  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working
that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of
their error which was meet.

 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are
not convenient;  Being filled with all unrighteousness,
fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy,
murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  Backbiters, haters
of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things,
disobedient to parents,  Without understanding, covenantbreakers,
without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful  Who knowing
the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of
death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
judgest for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;
for thou that judgest doest the same things.

 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
against them which commit such things.

 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of
God?   Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee
to repentance?   But after thy hardness and impenitent heart
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and
revelation of the righteous judgment of God;  Who will render to
every man according to his deeds  To them who by patient
continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality,
eternal life  But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey
the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 
Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of
the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;  But glory, honour, and
peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to
the Gentile  For there is no respect of persons with God.

 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
doers of the law shall be justified.

 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
themselves  Which shew the work of the law written in their
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)  In the day
when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to
my gospel.

 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
thy boast of God,  And knowest his will, and approvest the things
that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;  And art
confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them
which are in darkness,  An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?  
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit
adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?  
Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law
dishonourest thou God?   For the name of God is blasphemed among
the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law but if
thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?  
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law,
judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the
law?   For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is
that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh  But he is a
Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in
the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of
God.

 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
circumcision?   Much every way chiefly, because that unto them
were committed the oracles of God.

 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
faith of God without effect?   God forbid yea, let God be true,
but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be
justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a
man)  God forbid for then how shall God judge the world?   For
if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory;
why yet am I also judged as a sinner?   And not rather, (as we be
slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do
evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise for we have
before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one 
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
God.

 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips  Whose mouth
is full of cursing and bitterness  Their feet are swift to shed
blood  Destruction and misery are in their ways  And the way
of peace have they not known  There is no fear of God before
their eyes.

 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped, and all
the world may become guilty before God.

 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets;  Even the
righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
upon all them that believe for there is no difference  For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Being justified
freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
past, through the forbearance of God;  To declare, I say, at this
time his righteousness that he might be just, and the justifier of
him which believeth in Jesus.

 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
Nay but by the law of faith.

 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
the deeds of the law.

 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?
Yes, of the Gentiles also  Seeing it is one God, which shall
justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid yea, we
establish the law.

 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to
the flesh, hath found?   For if Abraham were justified by works, he
hath whereof to glory; but not before God.

 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
counted unto him for righteousness.

 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but
of debt.

 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
whom God imputeth righteousness without works,  Saying, Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon
the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham
for righteousness.

 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that
he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also 
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision
only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father
Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.

 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not
to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the
righteousness of faith.

 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
and the promise made of none effect  Because the law worketh
wrath for where no law is, there is no transgression.

 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end
the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is
of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is
the father of us all,  (As it is written, I have made thee a
father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who
quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though
they were.

 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall
thy seed be.

 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness
of Sarah's womb  He staggered not at the promise of God through
unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;  And being
fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to
perform.

 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
him;  But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe
on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;  Who was
delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
justification.

 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ  By whom also we have access by faith into
this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also knowing that
tribulation worketh patience;  And patience, experience; and
experience, hope  And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us.

 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
the ungodly.

 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die.

 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us.

 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
saved from wrath through him.

 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by
his life.

 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned 
(For until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when
there is no law.

 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who
is the figure of him that was to come.

 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the
gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
many.

 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift for the
judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
offences unto justification.

 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they
which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)   Therefore as by the
offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by
the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justification of life.

 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
where sin abounded, grace did much more abound  That as sin hath
reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound?   God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
longer therein?   Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?   Therefore we are
buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised
up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should
walk in newness of life.

 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection  Knowing
this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin
might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
with him  Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no
more; death hath no more dominion over him.

 For in that he died, he died unto sin once but in that he
liveth, he liveth unto God.

 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
obey it in the lusts thereof.

 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from
the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

 For sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under
the law, but under grace.

 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
under grace? God forbid.

 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,
his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
obedience unto righteousness?   But God be thanked, that ye were
the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you.

 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
righteousness.

 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
righteousness unto holiness.

 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
righteousness.

 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.

 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye
have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)
how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband
so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from
the law of her husband.

 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another
man, she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead,
she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be
married to another man.

 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the
body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who
is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.

 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by
the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.

 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
oldness of the letter.

 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
known sin, but by the law for I had not known lust, except the law
had said, Thou shalt not covet.

 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

 For I was alive without the law once but when the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died.

 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
unto death.

 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
it slew me.

 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
and good.

 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is
good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

 For we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal, sold
under sin.

 For that which I do I allow not for what I would, that do I not;
but what I hate, that do I.

 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that
it is good.

 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
thing for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which
is good I find not.

 For the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would
not, that I do.

 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
that dwelleth in me.

 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
with me.

 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man  But I
see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and
bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.

 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
this death?   I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then
with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the
law of sin.

 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
free from the law of sin and death.

 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
for sin, condemned sin in the flesh  That the righteousness of the
law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit.

 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded
is life and peace.

 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ, he is none of his.

 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
Spirit is life because of righteousness.

 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
after the flesh.

 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die but if ye through
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
God.

 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
the children of God  And if children, then heirs; heirs of God,
and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we
may be also glorified together.

 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God.

 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  Because the
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now.

 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

 For we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for
what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?   But if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the
will of God.

 And we know that all things work together for good to them that
love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn
among many brethren.

 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called and whom
he called, them he also justified and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.

 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
be against us?   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him
up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
things?   Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It
is God that justifieth.

 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.

 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?   As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day
long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
that loved us.

 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
me witness in the Holy Ghost,  That I have great heaviness and
continual sorrow in my heart.

 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh  Who are Israelites;
to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and
the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 
Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
not all Israel, which are of Israel  Neither, because they are the
seed of Abraham, are they all children but, In Isaac shall thy seed
be called.

 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not
the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for
the seed.

 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
Sarah shall have a son.

 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
even by our father Isaac;  (For the children being not yet born,
neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God
according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that
calleth;)  It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the
younger.

 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
forbid.

 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that sheweth mercy.

 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my
name might be declared throughout all the earth.

 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
will he hardeneth.

 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who
hath resisted his will?   Nay but, O man, who art thou that
repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed
it, Why hast thou made me thus?   Hath not the potter power over
the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another
unto dishonour?   What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to
make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction  And that he might make known the
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore
prepared unto glory,  Even us, whom he hath called, not of the
Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?   As he saith also in Osee, I
will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved,
which was not beloved.

 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the
children of the living God.

 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be
saved  For he will finish the work, and cut it short in
righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the
righteousness which is of faith.

 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath
not attained to the law of righteousness.

 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by
the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that
they might be saved.

 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge.

 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about
to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of God.

 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth.

 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That
the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to
bring Christ down from above)  Or, Who shall descend into the
deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)   But
what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy
heart that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  That if thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in
thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
saved.

 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
ashamed.

 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for
the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.

 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how
shall they hear without a preacher?   And how shall they preach,
except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good
things!   But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias
saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?   So then faith cometh
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish
nation I will anger you.

 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.

 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also
am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not
what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God
against Israel saying,  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and
digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of
Baal.

 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
according to the election of grace.

 And if by grace, then is it no more of works otherwise grace is
no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace
otherwise work is no more work.

 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not
hear;) unto this day.

 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and
a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them  Let their eyes be
darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.

 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the
Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their
fulness?   For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office  If by any means
I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save
some of them.

 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  
For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy and if the root
be holy, so are the branches.

 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest
of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  Boast not against the
branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root
thee.

 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
be graffed in.

 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear  For if God
spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not
thee.

 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which
fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his
goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
graffed in for God is able to graff them in again.

 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree
how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed
into their own olive tree?   For I would not, brethren, that ye
should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own
conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the
fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

 And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written, There shall
come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob  For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
their sins.

 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes but
as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.

 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
obtained mercy through their unbelief  Even so have these also
now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.

 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
mercy upon all.

 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding
out!   For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been
his counsellor?   Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be
recompensed unto him again?   For of him, and through him, and to
him, are all things to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service.

 And be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;
but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the
measure of faith.

 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
the same office  So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and
every one members one of another.

 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion
of faith;  Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering or he that
teacheth, on teaching;  Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation he
that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with
diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
cleave to that which is good.

 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
honour preferring one another;  Not slothful in business; fervent
in spirit; serving the Lord;  Rejoicing in hope; patient in
tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;  Distributing to the
necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

 Bless them which persecute you bless, and curse not.

 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
sight of all men.

 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
all men.

 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
unto wrath for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
the Lord.

 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God.

 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou
shalt have praise of the same  For he is the minister of God to
thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of God, a
revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
for conscience sake.

 For for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are God's
ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

 Render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is
due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law.

 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt
not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.

 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law.

 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

 The night is far spent, the day is at hand let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
envying.

 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for
the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
disputations.

 For one believeth that he may eat all things another, who is
weak, eateth herbs.

 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not
him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received him.

 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own
master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up for God is
able to make him stand.

 One man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every
day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that
eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die,
we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore, or die, we are the
Lord's.

 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
might be Lord both of the dead and living.

 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
Christ.

 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

 Let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this
rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
brother's way.

 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
unclean, to him it is unclean.

 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

 Let not then your good be evil spoken of  For the kingdom
of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in
the Holy Ghost.

 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
and approved of men.

 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
and things wherewith one may edify another.

 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that
condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not
of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak, and not to please ourselves.

 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
edification.

 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
have hope.

 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus  That ye
may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to
the glory of God.

 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and
sing unto thy name.

 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
ye people.

 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he
that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles
trust.

 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy
Ghost.

 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also
are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish
one another.

 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you
in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is
given to me of God,  That I should be the minister of Jesus
Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the
offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by
the Holy Ghost.

 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
those things which pertain to God.

 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ
hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and
deed,  Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the
Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum,
I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation 
But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see
and they that have not heard shall understand.

 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
you.

 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
desire these many years to come unto you;  Whensoever I take my
journey into Spain, I will come to you for I trust to see you in my
journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be
somewhat filled with your company.

 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if
the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in
your prayers to God for me;  That I may be delivered from them
that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for
Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;  That I may come unto
you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the
church which is at Cenchrea  That ye receive her in the Lord, as
becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she
hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself
also.

 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus  Who
have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only I give
thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.

 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners,
who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
Aristobulus' household.

 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household
of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the
beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
brethren which are with them.

 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
salute you.

 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
them.

 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the
hearts of the simple.

 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
therefore on your behalf but yet I would have you wise unto that
which is good, and simple concerning evil.

 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
my kinsmen, salute you.

 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus
the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation
of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,  But
now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according
to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations
for the obedience of faith  To God only wise, be glory through
Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.



The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians


 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
God, and Sosthenes our brother,  Unto the church of God which is at
Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus
Christ our Lord, both their's and our's  Grace be unto you, and
peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which
is given you by Jesus Christ;  That in every thing ye are enriched
by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;  Even as the
testimony of Christ was confirmed in you  So that ye come behind
in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ  Who
shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the
day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no
divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the
same mind and in the same judgment.

 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I
of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
baptized in the name of Paul?   I thank God that I baptized none
of you, but Crispus and Gaius;  Lest any should say that I had
baptized in mine own name.

 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas besides, I know
not whether I baptized any other.

 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel not
with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none
effect.

 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of
this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  
For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,
it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
believe.

 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom
 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness;  But unto them which are called,
both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God is stronger than men.

 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called  But
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;
and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
things which are mighty;  And base things of the world, and things
which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to
bring to nought things that are  That no flesh should glory in
his presence.

 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption 
That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in
the Lord.

 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
Christ, and him crucified.

 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
trembling.

 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power 
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
power of God.

 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the
wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to
nought  But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory 
Which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him.

 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the Spirit
searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the
Spirit of God.

 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given
to us of God.

 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
things with spiritual.

 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned.

 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
judged of no man.

 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
him?  But we have the mind of Christ.

 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

 For ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying, and
strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?   For
while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye
not carnal?   Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers
by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?   I have
planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man
shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

 For we are labourers together with God ye are God's husbandry, ye
are God's building.

 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth
thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is
Jesus Christ.

 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble;  Every man's work shall be made
manifest for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed
by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward.

 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss but he
himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you?   If any man defile the temple of God, him
shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they
are vain.

 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;
 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;  And
ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
stewards of the mysteries of God.

 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
you, or of man's judgment yea, I judge not mine own self.

 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified but
he that judgeth me is the Lord.

 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make
manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have
praise of God.

 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to
think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed
up for one against another.

 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost
thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?   Now ye are full,
now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us and I would to
God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.

 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it
were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world,
and to angels, and to men.

 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.

 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;  And
labour, working with our own hands being reviled, we bless; being
persecuted, we suffer it  Being defamed, we intreat we are made
as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto
this day.

 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I
warn you.

 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have
ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through
the gospel.

 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,
not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.

 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
in the spirit of meekness?   It is reported commonly that there is
fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named
among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that
hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so
done this deed,  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are
gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ,  To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of
the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump?   Purge out therefore the old leaven,
that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our
passover is sacrificed for us  Therefore let us keep the feast,
not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness;
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye
needs go out of the world.

 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater,
or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not
to eat.

 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not
ye judge them that are within?   But them that are without God
judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before
the unjust, and not before the saints?   Do ye not know that the
saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you,
are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?   Know ye not that
we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set
them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his
brethren?   But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before
the unbelievers.

 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to
law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not
rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?   Nay, ye do wrong, and
defraud, and that your brethren.

 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God?  Be not deceived neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

 And such were some of you but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
the Spirit of our God.

 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the
power of any.

 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats but God shall
destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for
the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us
by his own power.

 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I
then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an
harlot? God forbid.

 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
body?  for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body;
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  
For ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body,
and in your spirit, which are God's.

 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me It is good for
a man not to touch a woman.

 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise
also the wife unto the husband.

 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the
wife.

 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come
together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath
his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
if they abide even as I.

 But if they cannot contain, let them marry for it is better to
marry than to burn.

 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not
the wife depart from her husband  But and if she depart, let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the
husband put away his wife.

 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord If any brother hath a wife
that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not
put her away.

 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he
be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children
unclean; but now are they holy.

 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to
peace.

 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy
wife?   But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised.

 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
keeping of the commandments of God.

 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it but if thou
mayest be made free, use it rather.

 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's
freeman likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's
servant.

 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with
God.

 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord yet I
give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be
faithful.

 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I
say, that it is good for a man so to be.

 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in
the flesh but I spare you.

 But this I say, brethren, the time is short it remaineth, that
both they that have wives be as though they had none;  And they
that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though
they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
 And they that use this world, as not abusing it for the fashion
of this world passeth away.

 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the
Lord  But he that is married careth for the things that are of
the world, how he may please his wife.

 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be
holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for
the things of the world, how she may please her husband.

 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare
upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon
the Lord without distraction.

 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let
him do what he will, he sinneth not let them marry.

 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in
his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she
will; only in the Lord.

 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment and I
think also that I have the Spirit of God.

 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing
yet as he ought to know.

 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in
the world, and that there is none other God but one.

 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)  But to us there is
but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and
one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.

 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with
conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto
an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.

 But meat commendeth us not to God for neither, if we eat, are we
the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a
stumblingblock to them that are weak.

 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be
emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;  And
through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ
died?   But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their
weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.

 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?   If I be not an apostle
unto others, yet doubtless I am to you for the seal of mine
apostleship are ye in the Lord.

 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,  Have we not
power to eat and to drink?   Have we not power to lead about a
sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the
Lord, and Cephas?   Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to
forbear working?   Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?
who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?   Say I
these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?   For it
is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the
ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?   Or
saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is
written that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that
thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.

 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if
we shall reap your carnal things?   If others be partakers of this
power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this
power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of
Christ.

 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are
partakers with the altar?   Even so hath the Lord ordained that
they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.

 But I have used none of these things neither have I written
these things, that it should be so done unto me for it were better
for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.

 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of for
necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the
gospel!   For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward but
if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.

 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I
may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my
power in the gospel.

 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant
unto all, that I might gain the more.

 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;
to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain
them that are under the law;  To them that are without law, as
without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to
Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.

 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak I am
made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker
thereof with you.

 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an
incorruptible.

 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
that beateth the air  But I keep under my body, and bring it into
subjection lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I
myself should be a castaway.

 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how
that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the
sea;  And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the
sea;  And did all eat the same spiritual meat;  And did all
drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual Rock
that followed them and that Rock was Christ.

 But with many of them God was not well pleased for they were
overthrown in the wilderness.

 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not
lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
were destroyed of serpents.

 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
destroyed of the destroyer.

 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they
are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
come.

 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
fall.

 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man
but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.

 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion
of the body of Christ?   For we being many are one bread, and one
body for we are all partakers of that one bread.

 Behold Israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the
sacrifices partakers of the altar?   What say I then? that the
idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is
any thing?   But I say, that the things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God and I would not
that ye should have fellowship with devils.

 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils ye
cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.

 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question
for conscience sake  For the earth is the Lord's, and the
fulness thereof.

 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question
for conscience sake.

 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake
for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof 
Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other for why is my
liberty judged of another man's conscience?   For if I by grace
be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give
thanks?   Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye
do, do all to the glory of God.

 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
to the church of God  Even as I please all men in all things,
not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be
saved.

 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;
and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.

 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
dishonoureth his head.

 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she
were shaven.

 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn but if it
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is
the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man.

 For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man.

 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
man.

 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
of the angels.

 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
woman without the man, in the Lord.

 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
woman; but all things of God.

 Judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God
uncovered?   Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a
man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?   But if a woman have
long hair, it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a
covering.

 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God.

 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
come together not for the better, but for the worse.

 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
approved may be made manifest among you.

 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
eat the Lord's supper.

 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and
one is hungry, and another is drunken.

 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to
you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread  And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take, eat this is my body, which is broken for you this do in
remembrance of me.

 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye, as oft
as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.

 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
shew the Lord's death till he come.

 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
Lord.

 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,
and drink of that cup.

 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
sleep.

 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
should not be condemned with the world.

 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one
for another.

 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I
come.

 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
ignorant.

 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
idols, even as ye were led.

 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed and that no man can say that
Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
which worketh all in all.

 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
profit withal.

 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;  To another faith by the
same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another
the interpretation of tongues  But all these worketh that one
and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
members of that one body, being many, are one body so also is Christ.

 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all
made to drink into one Spirit.

 For the body is not one member, but many.

 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the body?   And if the ear shall
say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore
not of the body?   If the whole body were an eye, where were the
hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it
hath pleased him.

 And if they were all one member, where were the body?   But
now are they many members, yet but one body.

 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee
nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
feeble, are necessary  And those members of the body, which we
think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant
honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

 For our comely parts have no need but God hath tempered the
body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which
lacked.

 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
should have the same care one for another.

 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
workers of miracles?   Have all the gifts of healing? do all
speak with tongues? do all interpret?   But covet earnestly the
best gifts and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.

 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I
could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.

 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,  Doth not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil;  Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things.

 Charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies, they
shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there
be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away.

 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child but when I became a man, I put away childish
things.

 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face
now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
greatest of these is charity.

 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that
ye may prophesy.

 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men,
but unto God for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he
speaketh mysteries.

 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
that prophesieth edifieth the church.

 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh
with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive
edifying.

 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation,
or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?   And even
things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they
give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped
or harped?   For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall
prepare himself to the battle?   So likewise ye, except ye utter
by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what
is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.

 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
none of them is without signification.

 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a
barbarian unto me.

 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
he may interpret.

 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
understanding is unfruitful.

 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit, and I will
sing with the understanding also.

 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks,
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?   For thou verily
givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.

 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all  Yet
in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding,
that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in
an unknown tongue.

 Brethren, be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be
ye children, but in understanding be men.

 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not
hear me, saith the LORD.

 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that
believe not, but for them which believe.

 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are
unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one
unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all  And thus
are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his
face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.

 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation,
hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
first hold his peace.

 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
may be comforted.

 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
churches of the saints.

 Let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not
permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under
obedience as also saith the law.

 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at
home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
only?   If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual,
let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the
commandments of the Lord.

 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak
with tongues.

 Let all things be done decently and in order.

 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according
to the scriptures  And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the
twelve  After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are
fallen asleep.

 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
time.

 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called
an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

 But by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
they all yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
believed.

 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?   But
if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen
 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
faith is also vain.

 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up, if
so be that the dead rise not.

 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised  And
if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.

 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
most miserable.

 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
firstfruits of them that slept.

 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead.

 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive.

 But every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits;
afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all
authority and power.

 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all
things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which
did put all things under him.

 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him,
that God may be all in all.

 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?   I protest by your
rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.

 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink;
for to morrow we die.

 Be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners.

 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
knowledge of God I speak this to your shame.

 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
body do they come?   Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die  And that which thou sowest, thou
sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of
wheat, or of some other grain  But God giveth it a body as it
hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.

 All flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh
of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of
birds.

 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial but the
glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is
another.

 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another
star in glory.

 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption  It is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness; it is raised
in power  It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;
the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
Lord from heaven.

 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy and as is
the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear
the image of the heavenly.

 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed,  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality.

 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.

 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that
your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I
come.

 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia
for I do pass through Macedonia.

 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that
ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
while with you, if the Lord permit.

 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are
many adversaries.

 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear
for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

 Let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in
peace, that he may come unto me for I look for him with the brethren.

 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at
this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.

 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

 Let all your things be done with charity.

 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted
themselves to the ministry of the saints,)  That ye submit
yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and
laboureth.

 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.

 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's therefore
acknowledge ye them that are such.

 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with
an holy kiss.

 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
Anathema Maranatha.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.



The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians


 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy
our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the
saints which are in all Achaia  Grace be to you and peace from God
our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;  Who comforteth us
in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are
in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
God.

 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ.

 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer or whether we be comforted, it is for your
consolation and salvation.

 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life  But we had the
sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,
but in God which raiseth the dead  Who delivered us from so great
a death, and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver
us;  Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by
many on our behalf.

 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that
in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more
abundantly to you-ward.

 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;  As
also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even
as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.

 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that
ye might have a second benefit;  And to pass by you into
Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to
be brought on my way toward Judaea.

 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with
me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?   But as God is true, our
word toward you was not yea and nay.

 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by
us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in
him was yea.

 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
the glory of God by us.

 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed
us, is God;  Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the
Spirit in our hearts.

 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you
I came not as yet unto Corinth.

 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
your joy for by faith ye stand.

 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to
you in heaviness.

 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but
the same which is made sorry by me?   And I wrote this same unto
you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought
to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of
you all.

 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know
the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part
that I may not overcharge you all.

 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted
of many.

 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow.

 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
him.

 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of
you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also for if I forgave
any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the
person of Christ;  Lest Satan should get an advantage of us for
we are not ignorant of his devices.

 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and
a door was opened unto me of the Lord,  I had no rest in my
spirit, because I found not Titus my brother but taking my leave of
them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every
place.

 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
saved, and in them that perish  To the one we are the savour of
death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And
who is sufficient for these things?   For we are not as many,
which corrupt the word of God but as of sincerity, but as of God, in
the sight of God speak we in Christ.

 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation
from you?   Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and
read of all men  Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
of the heart.

 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward  Not that we
are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God;  Who also hath made us able ministers of
the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit for the
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory
was to be done away  How shall not the ministration of the spirit
be rather glorious?   For if the ministration of condemnation be
glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in
glory.

 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.

 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
remaineth is glorious.

 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
speech  And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that
the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that
which is abolished  But their minds were blinded for until this
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old
testament; which vail is done away in Christ.

 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
their heart.

 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
taken away.

 Now the Lord is that Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty.

 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as
by the Spirit of the LORD.

 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
we faint not;  But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,
not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's
conscience in the sight of God.

 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost  In
whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
the image of God, should shine unto them.

 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not of us.

 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
perplexed, but not in despair;  Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast
down, but not destroyed;  Always bearing about in the body the
dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made
manifest in our body.

 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
flesh.

 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
speak;  Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise
up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;  While we
look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not
seen for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which
are not seen are eternal.

 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.

 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
our house which is from heaven  If so be that being clothed we
shall not be found naked.

 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened not
for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might
be swallowed up of life.

 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at
home in the body, we are absent from the Lord  (For we walk by
faith, not by sight)  We are confident, I say, and willing rather
to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
accepted of him.

 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that
he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we
are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your
consciences.

 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer
them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.

 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God or whether we
be sober, it is for your cause.

 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
that if one died for all, then were all dead  And that he died
for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto
themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.

 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea, though
we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him
no more.

 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature old
things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed
unto us the word of reconciliation.

 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
you by us we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him.

 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye
receive not the grace of God in vain.

 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the
day of salvation have I succoured thee behold, now is the accepted
time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)   Giving no offence in
any thing, that the ministry be not blamed  But in all things
approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in
afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,  In stripes, in
imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 
By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy
Ghost, by love unfeigned,  By the word of truth, by the power of
God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report as
deceivers, and yet true;  As unknown, and yet well known; as dying,
and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;  As sorrowful,
yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing,
and yet possessing all things.

 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
enlarged.

 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
bowels.

 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,)
be ye also enlarged.

 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
hath light with darkness?   And what concord hath Christ with
Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?   And
what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.

 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.

 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we
have defrauded no man.

 I speak not this to condemn you for I have said before, that ye
are in our hearts to die and live with you.

 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
you I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our
tribulation.

 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but
we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were
fears.

 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
comforted us by the coming of Titus;  And not by his coming only,
but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told
us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so
that I rejoiced the more.

 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
I did repent for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you
sorry, though it were but for a season.

 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye
might receive damage by us in nothing.

 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement
desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have
approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.

 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but
that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.

 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea, and exceedingly
the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was
refreshed by you all.

 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting,
which I made before Titus, is found a truth.

 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye
received him.

 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.

 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
on the churches of Macedonia;  How that in a great trial of
affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded
unto the riches of their liberality.

 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
they were willing of themselves;  Praying us with much intreaty
that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the
ministering to the saints.

 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would
also finish in you the same grace also.

 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,
and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that
ye abound in this grace also.

 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his
poverty might be rich.

 And herein I give my advice for this is expedient for you, who
have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that
which ye have.

 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened  But
by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply
for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your
want that there may be equality  As it is written, He that had
gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no
lack.

 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
heart of Titus for you.

 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
of his own accord he went unto you.

 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
gospel throughout all the churches;  And not that only, but who
was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace,
which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and
declaration of your ready mind  Avoiding this, that no man should
blame us in this abundance which is administered by us  Providing
for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the
sight of men.

 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the
great confidence which I have in you.

 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of, they are
the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of
your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
for me to write to you  For I know the forwardness of your mind,
for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a
year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.

 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be
in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready  Lest
haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we
(that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident
boasting.

 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof
ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of
bounty, and not as of covetousness.

 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully.

 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;
not grudgingly, or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful giver.

 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good
work  (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given
to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever.

 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of
your righteousness;)  Being enriched in every thing to all
bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto
God;  Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify
God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for
your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;  And by
their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of
God in you.

 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold
toward you  But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am
present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.

 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh
 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)  Casting down
imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ;  And having in a readiness to revenge all
disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this
again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which
the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction,
I should not be ashamed  That I may not seem as if I would
terrify you by letters.

 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are
present.

 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring
themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves,
are not wise.

 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but
according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us,
a measure to reach even unto you.

 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in
preaching the gospel of Christ  Not boasting of things without
our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when
your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to
our rule abundantly,  To preach the gospel in the regions beyond
you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to
our hand.

 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
Lord commendeth.

 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly and
indeed bear with me.

 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have
espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin
to Christ.

 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in Christ.

 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not
preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received,
or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with
him.

 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.

 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to
no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from
Macedonia supplied and in all things I have kept myself from being
burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.

 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
boasting in the regions of Achaia.

 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from
them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found
even as we.

 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ.

 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
light.

 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be
according to their works.

 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a
fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you
on the face.

 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold
also.

 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in
labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more
frequent, in deaths oft.

 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in
perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in
the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
among false brethren;  In weariness and painfulness, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
daily, the care of all the churches.

 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
mine infirmities.

 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of
the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me  And
through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped
his hands.

 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord.

 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the
body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell God
knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.

 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body,
I cannot tell God knoweth;)  How that he was caught up into
paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a
man to utter.

 Of such an one will I glory yet of myself I will not glory, but
in mine infirmities.

 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I
will say the truth but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me
above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above
measure.

 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
from me.

 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee for my
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
me.

 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake for
when I am weak, then am I strong.

 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me for I
ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am I behind the
very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this
wrong.

 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not
be burdensome to you for I seek not your's but you for the children
ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

 But be it so, I did not burden you nevertheless, being crafty,
I caught you with guile.

 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a
gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the
same steps?   Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?
we speak before God in Christ but we do all things, dearly beloved,
for your edifying.

 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest
there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,
swellings, tumults  And lest, when I come again, my God will
humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned
already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
lasciviousness which they have committed.

 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or
three witnesses shall every word be established.

 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore
have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not
spare  Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to
you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.

 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with
him by the power of God toward you.

 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
except ye be reprobates?   But I trust that ye shall know that we
are not reprobates.

 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as
reprobates.

 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong and this
also we wish, even your perfection.

 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present
I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath
given me to edification, and not to destruction.

 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be
of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be
with you.

 Greet one another with an holy kiss.

 All the saints salute you.

 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians


 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)  And all
the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia 
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus
Christ,  Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us
from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
Father  To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of Christ unto another gospel  Which is not another; but
there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of
Christ.

 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed.

 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
of me is not after man.

 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
the revelation of Jesus Christ.

 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and
wasted it  And profited in the Jews' religion above many my
equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my fathers.

 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb,
and called me by his grace,  To reveal his Son in me, that I might
preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh
and blood  Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were
apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
Damascus.

 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
abode with him fifteen days.

 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
brother.

 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
not.

 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;  And
was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ
 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

 And they glorified God in me.

 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which
were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in
vain.

 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
to be circumcised  And that because of false brethren unawares
brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage  To whom we
gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the
gospel might continue with you.

 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
maketh no matter to me God accepteth no man's person) for they who
seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me  But
contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was
committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;
 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of
the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles) 
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and
they unto the circumcision.

 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which
I also was forward to do.

 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
because he was to be blamed.

 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision.

 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being
a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews,
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?   We who
are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,  Knowing that
a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of
Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law for
by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God
forbid.

 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself
a transgressor.

 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto
God.

 I am crucified with Christ neverthless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live
by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

 I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by
the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
forth, crucified among you?   This only would I learn of you,
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith?   Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now
made perfect by the flesh?   Have ye suffered so many things in
vain? if it be yet in vain.

 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
hearing of faith?   Even as Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for righteousness.

 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
children of Abraham.

 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In
thee shall all nations be blessed.

 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse
for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it
is evident for, The just shall live by faith.

 And the law is not of faith but, The man that doeth them shall
live in them.

 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree  That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit
through faith.

 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth
thereto.

 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
Christ.

 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of
God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise
but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was
made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid for if
there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
righteousness should have been by the law.

 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto
the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
that we might be justified by faith.

 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
schoolmaster.

 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ.

 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
according to the promise.

 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;  But is under
tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
elements of the world  But when the fulness of the time was come,
God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,  To
redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons.

 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir of God through Christ.

 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
by nature are no gods.

 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye
desire again to be in bondage?   Ye observe days, and months, and
times, and years.

 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.

 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are ye have
not injured me at all.

 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
unto you at the first.

 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own
eyes, and have given them to me.

 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude
you, that ye might affect them.

 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing,
and not only when I am present with you.

 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
be formed in you,  I desire to be present with you now, and to
change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.

 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law?   For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
of the freewoman was by promise.

 Which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Agar.

 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all.

 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband.

 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman.

 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
the free.

 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
shall profit you nothing.

 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
debtor to do the whole law.

 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
faith.

 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
truth?   This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,
whosoever he be.

 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
consumed one of another.

 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh.

 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would.

 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  Idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies,  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
God.

 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith,  Meekness, temperance against such
there is no law.

 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts.

 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another.

 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
deceiveth himself.

 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

 For every man shall bear his own burden.

 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things.

 Be not deceived; God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
life everlasting.

 And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not.

 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
hand.

 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
persecution for the cross of Christ.

 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.

 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature.

 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

 From henceforth let no man trouble me for I bear in my body the
marks of the Lord Jesus.

 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

Amen.



The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians


 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
Jesus Christ.

 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ
 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,  To
the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
in the beloved.

 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, according to the riches of his grace;  Wherein he hath
abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;  Having made known
unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which
he hath purposed in himself  That in the dispensation of the
fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ,
both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him  In
whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the
counsel of his own will  That we should be to the praise of his
glory, who first trusted in Christ.

 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,
the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed, ye
were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,  Which is the
earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
possession, unto the praise of his glory.

 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
and love unto all the saints,  Cease not to give thanks for you,
making mention of you in my prayers;  That the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him  The eyes of your
understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of
his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in
the saints,  And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to
us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,  Far above
all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name
that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to
come  And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be
the head over all things to the church,  Which is his body, the
fulness of him that filleth all in all.

 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience  Among whom also
we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by
nature the children of wrath, even as others.

 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
loved us,  Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)  And hath raised us
up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus  That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches
of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves it is the gift of God  Not of works, lest any man
should boast.

 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the
Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;  That at that time ye
were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without
God in the world  But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were
far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.

 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
the middle wall of partition between us;  Having abolished in his
flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in
ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making
peace;  And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by
the cross, having slain the enmity thereby  And came and preached
peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
Father.

 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;  And
are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner stone;  In whom all the
building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the
Lord  In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of
God through the Spirit.

 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
Gentiles,  If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God
which is given me to you-ward  How that by revelation he made
known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 
Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery
of Christ)  Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of
men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the
Spirit;  That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same
body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel 
Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of
God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.

 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches
of Christ;  And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the
mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
who created all things by Jesus Christ  To the intent that now
unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known
by the church the manifold wisdom of God,  According to the
eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord  In
whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
which is your glory.

 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ,  Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to
be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;  That
Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and
grounded in love,  May be able to comprehend with all saints what
is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;  And to know
the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled
with all the fulness of God.

 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,
world without end. Amen.

 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,  With all lowliness
and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
hope of your calling;  One Lord, one faith, one baptism,  One
God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you
all.

 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
of the gift of Christ.

 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men.

 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
into the lower parts of the earth?   He that descended is the same
also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all
things.)   And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and
some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;  For the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ  Till we all come in the unity of
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ  That we
henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about
with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;  But speaking the
truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head,
even Christ  From whom the whole body fitly joined together and
compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
body unto the edifying of itself in love.

 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of
God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of
their heart  Who being past feeling have given themselves over
unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

 But ye have not so learned Christ;  If so be that ye have
heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus 
That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which
is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  And be renewed in
the spirit of your mind;  And that ye put on the new man, which
after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
neighbour for we are members one of another.

 Be ye angry, and sin not let not the sun go down upon your
wrath  Neither give place to the devil.

 Let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour,
working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to
give to him that needeth.

 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
the hearers.

 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption.

 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
speaking, be put away from you, with all malice  And be ye kind
one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for
Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;  And walk
in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us
an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not
be once named among you, as becometh saints;  Neither filthiness,
nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient but rather
giving of thanks.

 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ and of God.

 Let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these
things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord
walk as children of light  (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all
goodness and righteousness and truth;)  Proving what is acceptable
unto the Lord.

 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
rather reprove them.

 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
them in secret.

 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light
for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
the Lord is.

 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
the Spirit;  Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;  Submitting yourselves one to
another in the fear of God.

 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Lord.

 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church and he is the saviour of the body.

 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives
be to their own husbands in every thing.

 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it;  That he might sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word,  That he might present it
to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
loveth his wife loveth himself.

 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church  For we are members of
his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

 This is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the
church.

 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

 Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.

 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with
promise;  That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long
on the earth.

 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as
unto Christ;  Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the
servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;  With
good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men  Knowing
that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of
the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
threatening knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is
there respect of persons with him.

 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
his might.

 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
having on the breastplate of righteousness;  And your feet shod
with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  Above all, taking
the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked.

 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God  Praying always with all prayer and
supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all
perseverance and supplication for all saints;  And for me, that
utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to
make known the mystery of the gospel,  For which I am an
ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to
speak.

 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to
you all things  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,
that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
sincerity.

Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians


 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and
deacons  Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,  Always in every
prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,  For your
fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;  Being
confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in
you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ  Even as it is
meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart;
inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of
the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
bowels of Jesus Christ.

 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and in all judgment;  That ye may approve things that
are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day
of Christ.

 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which
happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the
gospel;  So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the
palace, and in all other places;  And many of the brethren in the
Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the
word without fear.

 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also
of good will  The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely,
supposing to add affliction to my bonds  But the other of love,
knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.

 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice.

 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,  According
to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be
ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ
shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.

 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour yet
what I shall choose I wot not.

 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and
to be with Christ; which is far better  Nevertheless to abide in
the flesh is more needful for you.

 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;  That
your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my
coming to you again.

 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
Christ that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear
of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind
striving together for the faith of the gospel;  And in nothing
terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of
perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;  Having the same
conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being
of one accord, of one mind.

 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness
of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
things of others.

 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus  Who,
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God
 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men  And being found in
fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross.

 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
which is above every name  That at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
the earth;  And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.

 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
good pleasure.

 Do all things without murmurings and disputings  That ye may
be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the
midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights
in the world;  Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice
in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in
vain.

 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
state.

 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he
hath served with me in the gospel.

 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
how it will go with me.

 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
that ye had heard that he had been sick.

 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death but God had mercy on him;
and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
sorrow.

 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
such in reputation  Because for the work of Christ he was nigh
unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service
toward me.

 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.

 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.

 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more 
Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the
loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is
of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith  That I may know him, and
the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
being made conformable unto his death;  If by any means I might
attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
perfect but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which
also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended but this one
thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things which are before,  I press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded and if
in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
you.

 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk
so as ye have us for an ensample.

 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ 
Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is
in their shame, who mind earthly things.)   For our conversation
is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
Christ  Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
able even to subdue all things unto himself.

 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
mind in the Lord.

 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which
laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my
fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

 Rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say, Rejoice.

 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
God.

 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these
things.

 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
and seen in me, do and the God of peace shall be with you.

 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye
lacked opportunity.

 Not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned, in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound every
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with
my affliction.

 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
necessity.

 Not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound
to your account.

 But I have all, and abound I am full, having received of
Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
glory by Christ Jesus.

 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with
me greet you.

 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
household.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians


  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
and Timotheus our brother,   To the saints and faithful brethren
in Christ which are at Colosse Grace be unto you, and peace,
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
always for you,
  Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye
have to all the saints,
  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
  Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth
fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the
grace of God in truth
  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you
a faithful minister of Christ;
  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his
will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
  That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
  Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
us into the kingdom of his dear Son
  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
sins
  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
creature
  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers all things were created by him, and for him
  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

  And he is the head of the body, the church who is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in
earth, or things in heaven.

  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
  In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
unblameable and unreproveable in his sight
  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached
to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
  Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is
the church
  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
  Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,
but now is made manifest to his saints
  To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory
  Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus
  Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
worketh in me mightily.

  For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
  That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
  In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

  For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in
Christ.

  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
him
  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after
Christ.

  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
power
  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision
of Christ
  Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all
trespasses;
  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
openly, triumphing over them in it.

  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days
  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.

  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen,
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
  And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands
having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the
increase of God.

  Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,
why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
  (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
  Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and
doctrines of men?
  Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
humility, and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying
of the flesh.

  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with him in glory.

  Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,
which is idolatry
  For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
disobedience
  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
filthy communication out of your mouth.

  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
his deeds;
  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the
image of him that created him
  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free but Christ is all, and in
all.

  Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
  Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

  And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
perfectness.

  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
Lord.

  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

  Children, obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing
unto the Lord.

  Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
discouraged.

  Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not
with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;
  And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
men;
  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ.

  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
done and there is no respect of persons.

  Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing
that ye also have a Master in heaven.

  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds
  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.

  Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
know how ye ought to answer every man.

  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord
  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know
your estate, and comfort your hearts;
  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They
shall make known unto you all things which are done here.

  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son
to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you,
receive him;)
  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort
unto me.

  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,
always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and
complete in all the will of God.

  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
church which is in his house.

  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also
in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from
Laodicea.

  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be
with you. Amen.




The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians


 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ.

 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
our prayers;  Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and
labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
sight of God and our Father;  Knowing, brethren beloved, your
election of God.

 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner
of men we were among you for your sake.

 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.

 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
Achaia.

 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward
is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.

 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and
true God;  And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised
from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it
was not in vain  But even after that we had suffered before, and
were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
guile  But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth
our hearts.

 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor
a cloke of covetousness; God is witness  Nor of men sought we
glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been
burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
children  So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing
to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our
own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail for labouring
night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we
preached unto you the gospel of God.

 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe  As ye
know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a
father doth his children,  That ye would walk worthy of God, who
hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not
as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
effectually worketh also in you that believe.

 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which
in Judaea are in Christ Jesus for ye also have suffered like things
of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews  Who both
killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us;
and they please not God, and are contrary to all men  Forbidding
us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their
sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your
face with great desire.

 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
again; but Satan hindered us.

 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?   For
ye are our glory and joy.

 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to
be left at Athens alone;  And sent Timotheus, our brother, and
minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to
establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith  That no
man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we
are appointed thereunto.

 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our
labour be in vain.

 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance
of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you 
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction
and distress by your faith  For now we live, if ye stand fast in
the Lord.

 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the
joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;  Night and day
praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect
that which is lacking in your faith?   Now God himself and our
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you  To the end
he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even
our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his
saints.

 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the
Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
please God, so ye would abound more and more.

 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
should abstain from fornication  That every one of you should know
how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;  Not in the
lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God 
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because
that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned
you and testified.

 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
also given unto us his holy Spirit.

 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
Macedonia but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and
more;  And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;  That ye may
walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack
of nothing.

 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have
no hope.

 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
them which are asleep.

 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God and the dead in
Christ shall rise first  Then we which are alive and remain shall
be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
air and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I
write unto you.

 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night.

 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall
not escape.

 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief.

 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day we
are not of the night, nor of darkness.

 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
sober.

 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night.

 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of
salvation.

 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
our Lord Jesus Christ,  Who died for us, that, whether we wake or
sleep, we should live together with him.

 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
even as also ye do.

 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;  And to
esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace
among yourselves.

 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort
the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.

 Rejoice evermore.

 Pray without ceasing.

 In every thing give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you.

 Quench not the Spirit.

 Despise not prophesyings.

 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

 Brethren, pray for us.

 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the
holy brethren.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.




The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians


 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ  Grace
unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every
one of you all toward each other aboundeth;  So that we ourselves
glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all
your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure  Which is a
manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be
counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer 
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you;  And to you who are troubled rest with us,
when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty
angels,  In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ  Who
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the Lord, and from the glory of his power;  When he shall come to
be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe
(because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count
you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness, and the work of faith with power  That the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to
the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,  That ye be not
soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word,
nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.

 Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come,
except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
revealed, the son of perdition;  Who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God
sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
things?   And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be
revealed in his time.

 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now
letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming  Even him, whose coming is after the
working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,  And
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish;
because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be
saved.

 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie  That they all might be damned who believed
not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
truth  Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of
the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and
good hope through grace,  Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in
every good word and work.

 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you  And that we
may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have
not faith.

 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
from evil.

 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
and will do the things which we command you.

 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
patient waiting for Christ.

 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.

 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not
ourselves disorderly among you;  Neither did we eat any man's bread
for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we
might not be chargeable to any of you  Not because we have not
power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.

 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
any would not work, neither should he eat.

 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
working not at all, but are busybodies.

 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
The Lord be with you all.

 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
every epistle so I write.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.




The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;  Unto Timothy,
my own son in the faith Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father
and Jesus Christ our Lord.

 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
doctrine,  Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,
which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in
faith so do.

 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned  From which some
having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;  Desiring to
be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor
whereof they affirm.

 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for
the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for
unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,
for manslayers,  For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves
with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if
there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
committed to my trust.

 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;  Who was
before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious but I obtained
mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
love which is in Christ Jesus.

 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which
should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a
good warfare;  Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some
having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck  Of whom is
Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they
may learn not to blaspheme.

 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;  For
kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and
peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
of the truth.

 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus;  Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be
testified in due time.

 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the
truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
verity.

 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
without wrath and doubting.

 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly array;  But (which becometh women
professing godliness) with good works.

 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
the man, but to be in silence.

 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
the transgression.

 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
desireth a good work.

 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to
teach;  Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;  One that ruleth well his
own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 
(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the church of God?)   Not a novice, lest being lifted up
with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given
to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;  Holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience.

 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office
of a deacon, being found blameless.

 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
faithful in all things.

 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
children and their own houses well.

 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to
themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in
Christ Jesus.

 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly
 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God
was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
glory.

 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
doctrines of devils;  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their
conscience seared with a hot iron;  Forbidding to marry, and
commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be
received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.

 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if
it be received with thanksgiving  For it is sanctified by the word
of God and prayer.

 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of
faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
rather unto godliness.

 For bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable
unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that
which is to come.

 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of
those that believe.

 These things command and teach.

 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith,
in purity.

 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
doctrine.

 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
profiting may appear to all.

 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them
for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear
thee.

 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger
men as brethren;  The elder women as mothers; the younger as
sisters, with all purity.

 Honour widows that are widows indeed.

 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to
shew piety at home, and to requite their parents for that is good and
acceptable before God.

 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
old, having been the wife of one man.

 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,
if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if
she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every
good work.

 But the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax
wanton against Christ, they will marry;  Having damnation, because
they have cast off their first faith.

 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking
things which they ought not.

 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully.

 For some are already turned aside after Satan.

 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that
are widows indeed.

 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.

 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
three witnesses.

 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one
before another, doing nothing by partiality.

 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's
sins keep thyself pure.

 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
sake and thine often infirmities.

 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
and some men they follow after.

 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and
they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not
blasphemed.

 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they
are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach
and exhort.

 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is
according to godliness;  He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting
about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife,
railings, evil surmisings,  Perverse disputings of men of corrupt
minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness
from such withdraw thyself.

 But godliness with contentment is great gain.

 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out.

 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction
and perdition.

 For the love of money is the root of all evil which while some
coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows.

 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession
before many witnesses.

 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a
good confession;  That thou keep this commandment without spot,
unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ  Which
in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the
King of kings, and Lord of lords;  Who only hath immortality,
dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath
seen, nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy;  That they do good, that
they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to
communicate;  Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so
called  Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.
Grace be with thee. Amen.




The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to
the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,  To Timothy,
my dearly beloved son Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.

 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my
prayers night and day;  Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful
of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;  When I call to
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in
thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that
in thee also.

 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind.

 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
according to the power of God;  Who hath saved us, and called us
with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
world began,  But is now made manifest by the appearing of our
Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life
and immortality to light through the gospel  Whereunto I am
appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

 For the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am
not ashamed for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he
is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me,
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
Ghost which dwelleth in us.

 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away
from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain  But, when he was
in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.

 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus,
thou knowest very well.

 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
Jesus.

 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach
others also.

 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
except he strive lawfully.

 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
fruits.

 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all
things.

 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from
the dead according to my gospel  Wherein I suffer trouble, as an
evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they
may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
glory.

 It is a faithful saying For if we be dead with him, we shall
also live with him  If we suffer, we shall also reign with him
if we deny him, he also will deny us  If we believe not, yet he
abideth faithful he cannot deny himself.

 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the
subverting of the hearers.

 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

 But shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto
more ungodliness.

 And their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is Hymenaeus
and Philetus;  Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that
the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to
dishonour.

 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared
unto every good work.

 Flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness, faith,
charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strifes.

 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all men, apt to teach, patient,  In meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance
to the acknowledging of the truth;  And that they may recover
themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him
at his will.

 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady,
highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a
form of godliness, but denying the power thereof from such turn away.

 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
the truth men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

 But they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be
manifest unto all men, as their's also was.

 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,  Persecutions,
afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra;
what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered
me.

 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution.

 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving,
and being deceived.

 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;  And that
from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness  That the man of God may be perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good works.

 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,
having itching ears;  And they shall turn away their ears from the
truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
at hand.

 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith  Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
that day and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
appearing.

 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me  For Demas hath
forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto
Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee for he
is profitable to me for the ministry.

 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the Lord reward him
according to his works  Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath
greatly withstood our words.

 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that
by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles
might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.

 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

 Erastus abode at Corinth but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
sick.

 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus


 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which
is after godliness;  In hope of eternal life, which God, that
cannot lie, promised before the world began;  But hath in due times
manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me
according to the commandment of God our Saviour;  To Titus, mine
own son after the common faith Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as
I had appointed thee  If any be blameless, the husband of one
wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.

 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given
to filthy lucre;  But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men,
sober, just, holy, temperate;  Holding fast the faithful word as he
hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort
and to convince the gainsayers.

 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
specially they of the circumcision  Whose mouths must be stopped,
who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
filthy lucre's sake.

 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
may be sound in the faith;  Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

 Unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled
and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is
defiled.

 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  That
the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity,
in patience.

 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
things;  That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love
their husbands, to love their children,  To be discreet, chaste,
keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word
of God be not blasphemed.

 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,  Sound speech, that
cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be
ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
please them well in all things; not answering again;  Not
purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men,  Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;  Who gave himself for us,
that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.

 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
Let no man despise thee.

 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,  To speak evil of
no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all
men.

 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
envy, hateful, and hating one another.

 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared,  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost;  Which he shed on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ our Saviour;  That being justified by his
grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be
careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable
unto men.

 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
reject;  Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth,
being condemned of himself.

 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to
come unto me to Nicopolis for I have determined there to winter.

 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently,
that nothing be wanting unto them.

 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses, that they be not unfruitful.

 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the
faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon


 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,  And to our
beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in
thy house  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.

 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus,
and toward all saints;  That the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in
you in Christ Jesus.

 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
that which is convenient,  Yet for love's sake I rather beseech
thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ.

 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds  Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
profitable to thee and to me  Whom I have sent again thou
therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels  Whom I would
have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto
me in the bonds of the gospel  But without thy mind would I do
nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but
willingly.

 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
shouldest receive him for ever;  Not now as a servant, but above a
servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto
thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?   If thou count me
therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
account;  I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay
it albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own
self besides.

 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord refresh my
bowels in the Lord.

 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
that thou wilt also do more than I say.

 But withal prepare me also a lodging for I trust that through
your prayers I shall be given unto you.

 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews


 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets,  Hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom
also he made the worlds;  Who being the brightness of his glory,
and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the
word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on
the right hand of the Majesty on high  Being made so much better
than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
name than they.

 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father,
and he shall be to me a Son?   And again, when he bringeth in the
firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God
worship him.

 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his
ministers a flame of fire.

 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,
even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.

 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands  They shall
perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;  And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall
be changed but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right
hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?   Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be
heirs of salvation?   Therefore we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let
them slip.

 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by
them that heard him;  God also bearing them witness, both with
signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Ghost, according to his own will?   For unto the angels hath he not
put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.

 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that
thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?
 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands
 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that
he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put
under him.

But now we see not yet all things put under him.

 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the
grace of God should taste death for every man.

 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
salvation perfect through sufferings.

 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the
church will I sing praise unto thee.

 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
the children which God hath given me.

 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage.

 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took
on him the seed of Abraham.

 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people.

 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
succour them that are tempted.

 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
faithful in all his house.

 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch
as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.

 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
things is God.

 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for
a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;  But
Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold
fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
voice,  Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day
of temptation in the wilderness  When your fathers tempted me,
proved me, and saw my works forty years.

 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do
alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)  
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the living God.

 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any
of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of
our confidence stedfast unto the end;  While it is said, To day if
ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.

 For some, when they had heard, did provoke howbeit not all that
came out of Egypt by Moses.

 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?   And to
whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them
that believed not?   So we see that they could not enter in
because of unbelief.

 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering
into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them but the
word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them
that heard it.

 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I
have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest although the
works were finished from the foundation of the world.

 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise,
And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and
they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after
so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice,
harden not your hearts.

 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have
spoken of another day.

 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
his own works, as God did from his.

 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
fall after the same example of unbelief.

 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart.

 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight
but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we
have to do.

 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into
the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
are, yet without sin.

 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins  Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them
that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
infirmity.

 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
himself, to offer for sins.

 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
of God, as was Aaron.

 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten
thee.

 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
after the order of Melchisedec.

 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;  Though he
were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
unto all them that obey him;  Called of God an high priest after
the order of Melchisedec.

 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
seeing ye are dull of hearing.

 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that
one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of
God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
righteousness for he is a babe.

 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both
good and evil.

 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us
go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance
from dead works, and of faith toward God,  Of the doctrine of
baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead,
and of eternal judgment.

 And this will we do, if God permit.

 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost,  And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
world to come,  If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto
repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,
and put him to an open shame.

 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,
receiveth blessing from God  But that which beareth thorns and
briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be
burned.

 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things
that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered
to the saints, and do minister.

 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to
the full assurance of hope unto the end  That ye be not slothful,
but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the
promises.

 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by
no greater, he sware by himself,  Saying, Surely blessing I will
bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

 For men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation
is to them an end of all strife.

 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath 
That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to
lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to
lay hold upon the hope set before us  Which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into
that within the veil;  Whither the forerunner is for us entered,
even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.

 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,
who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed
him;  To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of
Salem, which is, King of peace;  Without father, without mother,
without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life;
but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the
people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they
come out of the loins of Abraham  But he whose descent is not
counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had
the promises.

 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them,
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
in Abraham.

 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met
him.

 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
under it the people received the law,) what further need was there
that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and
not be called after the order of Aaron?   For the priesthood being
changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

 And it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of
Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  Who is made, not after
the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless
life.

 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.

 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better
hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest  (For
those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him
that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec)  By so much was
Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered
to continue by reason of death  But this man, because he
continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's for this
he did once, when he offered up himself.

 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the
word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is
consecrated for evermore.

 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum We have
such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens;  A minister of the sanctuary, and of the
true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices
wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to
offer.

 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that
there are priests that offer gifts according to the law  Who serve
unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was
admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle for, See,
saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to
thee in the mount.

 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much
also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established
upon better promises.

 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
place have been sought for the second.

 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of
Israel and with the house of Judah  Not according to the covenant
that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in
my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their
mind, and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God, and
they shall be to me a people  And they shall not teach every man
his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord for
all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins
and their iniquities will I remember no more.

 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now
that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
service, and a worldly sanctuary.

 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the
sanctuary.

 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
Holiest of all;  Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the
covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the
covenant;  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the
mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always
into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.

 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year,
not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of
the people  The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the
holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
tabernacle was yet standing  Which was a figure for the time then
present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could
not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the
conscience;  Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers
washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
reformation.

 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a
greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to
say, not of this building;  Neither by the blood of goats and
calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
flesh  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
conscience from dead works to serve the living God?   And for this
cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death,
for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
inheritance.

 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
death of the testator.

 For a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is
of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
blood.

 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with
water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and
all the people,  Saying, This is the blood of the testament which
God hath enjoined unto you.

 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the
vessels of the ministry.

 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
without shedding of blood is no remission.

 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
themselves with better sacrifices than these.

 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to
appear in the presence of God for us  Nor yet that he should
offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place
every year with blood of others;  For then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of
the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.

 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
judgment  So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many;
and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time
without sin unto salvation.

 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the
very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they
offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that
the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of
sins.

 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins
every year.

 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
should take away sins.

 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me  In
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
of me,) to do thy will, O God.

 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
therein; which are offered by the law;  Then said he, Lo, I come
to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish
the second.

 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
body of Jesus Christ once for all.

 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins 
But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,
sat down on the right hand of God;  From henceforth expecting
till his enemies be made his footstool.

 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified.

 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that
he had said before,  This is the covenant that I will make with
them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their
hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  And their sins and
iniquities will I remember no more.

 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
sin.

 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
by the blood of Jesus,  By a new and living way, which he hath
consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
And having an high priest over the house of God;  Let us draw
near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
water.

 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
(for he is faithful that promised;)  And let us consider one
another to provoke unto love and to good works  Not forsaking
the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but
exhorting one another and so much the more, as ye see the day
approaching.

 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  But a
certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which
shall devour the adversaries.

 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
three witnesses  Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall
he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and
hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified,
an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I
will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his
people.

 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  Partly,
whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions;
and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.

 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a
better and an enduring substance.

 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
recompence of reward.

 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
of God, ye might receive the promise.

 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry.

 Now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back, my
soul shall have no pleasure in him.

 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
that believe to the saving of the soul.

 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.

 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things
which do appear.

 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God
testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
was not found, because God had translated him for before his
translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

 But without faith it is impossible to please him for he that
cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek him.

 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the
which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness
which is by faith.

 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which
he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out,
not knowing whither he went.

 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
him of the same promise  For he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God.

 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she
judged him faithful who had promised.

 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so
many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by
the sea shore innumerable.

 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth.

 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
country.

 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence
they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly
wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath
prepared for them a city.

 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac and he
that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 
Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called 
Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from
whence also he received him in a figure.

 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of
the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.

 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not
afraid of the king's commandment.

 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh's daughter;  Choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season;  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of
the reward.

 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king
for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,
lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land which
the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
compassed about seven days.

 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
not, when she had received the spies with peace.

 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also,
and Samuel, and of the prophets  Who through faith subdued
kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths
of lions.

 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
flight the armies of the aliens.

 Women received their dead raised to life again and others were
tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better
resurrection  And others had trial of cruel mockings and
scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment  They were
stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the
sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being
destitute, afflicted, tormented;  (Of whom the world was not
worthy) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and
caves of the earth.

 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
received not the promise  God having provided some better thing
for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is
set before us,  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our
faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne
of God.

 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him  For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?   But if ye be
without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards,
and not sons.

 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,
and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection
unto the Father of spirits, and live?   For they verily for a few
days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit,
that we might be partakers of his holiness.

 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
knees;  And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
shall see the Lord  Looking diligently lest any man fail of the
grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you,
and thereby many be defiled;  Lest there be any fornicator, or
profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his
birthright.

 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the
blessing, he was rejected for he found no place of repentance, though
he sought it carefully with tears.

 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice
they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them
any more  (For they could not endure that which was commanded,
And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or
thrust through with a dart  And so terrible was the sight, that
Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake)  But ye are come unto
mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,  To the
general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in
heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men
made perfect,  And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and
to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of
Abel.

 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we
escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven 
Whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised, saying,
Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.

 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things
which cannot be shaken may remain.

 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear  For our God is a consuming fire.

 Let brotherly love continue.

 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares.

 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
with such things as ye have for he hath said, I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee.

 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
fear what man shall do unto me.

 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto
you the word of God whose faith follow, considering the end of their
conversation.

 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is
a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats,
which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.

 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve
the tabernacle.

 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.

 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his
own blood, suffered without the gate.

 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
reproach.

 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

 But to do good and to communicate forget not for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased.

 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves
for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that
they may do it with joy, and not with grief for that is unprofitable
for you.

 Pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
things willing to live honestly.

 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored
to you the sooner.

 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord
Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the
everlasting covenant,  Make you perfect in every good work to do
his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight,
through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation for
I have written a letter unto you in few words.

 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
if he come shortly, I will see you.

 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.

They of Italy salute you.

 Grace be with you all. Amen.




The General Epistle of James


 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations;  Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh
patience.

 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
entire, wanting nothing.

 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
Lord.

 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted 
But the rich, in that he is made low because as the flower of the
grass he shall pass away.

 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of
the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in
his ways.

 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is
tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
promised to them that love him.

 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God for God
cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man  But
every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
enticed.

 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin and sin,
when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning.

 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,
slow to speak, slow to wrath  For the wrath of man worketh not
the righteousness of God.

 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is
able to save your souls.

 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
own selves.

 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass  For he
beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what
manner of man he was.

 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
man shall be blessed in his deed.

 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
himself unspotted from the world.

 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
of glory, with respect of persons.

 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto
him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou
there, or sit here under my footstool  Are ye not then partial in
yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?   Hearken, my
beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in
faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that
love him?   But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress
you, and draw you before the judgment seats?   Do not they
blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?   If ye
fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself, ye do well  But if ye have respect to
persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.

 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a
transgressor of the law.

 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law
of liberty.

 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,
and have not works? can faith save him?   If a brother or sister
be naked, and destitute of daily food,  And one of you say unto
them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye
give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it
profit?   Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being
alone.

 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works shew me
thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my
works.

 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well the devils
also believe, and tremble.

 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
offered Isaac his son upon the altar?   Seest thou how faith
wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?   And
the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it
was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the Friend
of God.

 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
faith only.

 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when
she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
works is dead also.

 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
the greater condemnation.

 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word,
the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.

 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us;
and we turn about their whole body.

 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small
helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.

Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!   And the tongue
is a fire, a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members,
that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of
nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind  But
the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
poison.

 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we
men, which are made after the similitude of God.

 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
brethren, these things ought not so to be.

 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
bitter?   Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries?
either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and
fresh.

 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
not, and lie not against the truth.

 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
devilish.

 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
evil work.

 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
peace.

 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?   Ye lust, and
have not ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain ye fight and
war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
it upon your lusts.

 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of
the world is the enemy of God.

 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?   But he giveth more grace.
Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the
humble.

 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
flee from you.

 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep let your laughter be turned to
mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you
up.

 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
judgeth the law but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the
law, but a judge.

 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy who
art thou that judgest another?   Go to now, ye that say, To day or
to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and
buy and sell, and get gain  Whereas ye know not what shall be on
the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth
for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
this, or that.

 But now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil.

 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
him it is sin.

 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
come upon you.

 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have
heaped treasure together for the last days.

 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth and the cries of
them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
sabaoth.

 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.

 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.

Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,
and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter
rain.

 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts for the coming of the
Lord draweth nigh.

 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned
behold, the judge standeth before the door.

 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of
the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
neither by the earth, neither by any other oath but let your yea be
yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him
sing psalms.

 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord  And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be
forgiven him.

 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much.

 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by
the space of three years and six months.

 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
brought forth her fruit.

 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
him;  Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a
multitude of sins.




The First Epistle General of Peter


 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,  Elect
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.

 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,  To an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
reserved in heaven for you,  Who are kept by the power of God
through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations  That the trial
of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,
though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour
and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ  Whom having not seen,
ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice
with joy unspeakable and full of glory  Receiving the end of your
faith, even the salvation of your souls.

 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings
of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them
that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.

 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation
of Jesus Christ;  As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves
according to the former lusts in your ignorance  But as he which
hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear  Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not
redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
conversation received by tradition from your fathers;  But with
the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot  Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
world, but was manifest in these last times for you,  Who by him
do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him
glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently  Being born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
liveth and abideth for ever.

 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away
 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
which by the gospel is preached unto you.

 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, all evil speakings,  As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby  If so be ye
have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
but chosen of God, and precious,  Ye also, as lively stones, are
built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in
Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious and he that believeth on
him shall not be confounded.

 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them
which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the
same is made the head of the corner,  And a stone of stumbling, and
a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being
disobedient whereunto also they were appointed.

 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of
him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;
 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of
God which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;  Having your
conversation honest among the Gentiles that, whereas they speak
against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they
shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.

 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake
whether it be to the king, as supreme;  Or unto governors, as unto
them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the
praise of them that do well.

 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men  As free, and not using your
liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to
the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,
ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

 For even hereunto were ye called because Christ also suffered
for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps 
Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth  Who, when
he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened
not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously  Who
his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
dead to sins, should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were
healed.

 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,
if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the
conversation of the wives;  While they behold your chaste
conversation coupled with fear.

 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;  But let
it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
God of great price.

 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own
husbands  Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord whose
daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
amazement.

 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being
heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not
hindered.

 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous  Not rendering evil for
evil, or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing; knowing that
ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.

 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile  Let
him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.

 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that
do evil.

 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
which is good?   But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake,
happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meekness and fear  Having a good conscience; that,
whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed
that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.

 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well doing, than for evil doing.

 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
flesh, but quickened by the Spirit  By which also he went and
preached unto the spirits in prison;  Which sometime were
disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of
Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls
were saved by water.

 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not
the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ  Who
is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in
the flesh hath ceased from sin;  That he no longer should live the
rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of
God.

 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess
of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries 
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot, speaking evil of you  Who shall give account to
him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.

 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but
live according to God in the spirit.

 But the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober, and
watch unto prayer.

 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for
charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man
minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God
in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you  But
rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that,
when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy.

 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil
spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
let him glorify God on this behalf.

 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
God and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that
obey not the gospel of God?   And if the righteous scarcely be
saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?   Wherefore
let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping
of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and
a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed  Feed the flock of God which is among
you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;  Neither as being lords
over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
of glory that fadeth not away.

 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility for
God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he
may exalt you in due time  Casting all your care upon him; for he
careth for you.

 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour  Whom
resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you
perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace
of God wherein ye stand.

 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.

 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.




The Second General Epistle of Peter


 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ  Grace and peace
be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our
Lord,  According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him
that hath called us to glory and virtue  Whereby are given unto us
exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be
partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is
in the world through lust.

 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;
and to virtue knowledge;  And to knowledge temperance; and to
temperance patience; and to patience godliness;  And to godliness
brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.

 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
calling and election sure for if ye do these things, ye shall never
fall  For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established
in the present truth.

 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance;  Knowing that shortly I must
put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed
me.

 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
have these things always in remembrance.

 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty.

 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there
came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.

 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
him in the holy mount.

 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until
the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts  Knowing this
first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation.

 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but
holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
themselves swift destruction.

 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not,
and their damnation slumbereth not.

 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down
to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved
unto judgment;  And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the
eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon
the world of the ungodly;  And turning the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an
ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;  And delivered
just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked  (For
that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed
his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)  The
Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished  But
chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and
despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not
afraid to speak evil of dignities.

 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
railing accusation against them before the Lord.

 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and
shall utterly perish in their own corruption;  And shall receive
the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot
in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves
with their own deceivings while they feast with you;  Having eyes
full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable
souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed
children  Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness;  But was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass
speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure
through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that
were clean escaped from them who live in error.

 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants
of corruption for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.

 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are
again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with
them than the beginning.

 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them.

 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The
dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to
her wallowing in the mire.

 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which
I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance  That ye may be
mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,
and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour 
Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,
walking after their own lusts,  And saying, Where is the promise of
his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as
they were from the beginning of the creation.

 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God
the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and
in the water  Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed
with water, perished  But the heavens and the earth, which are
now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against
the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up.

 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 
Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the
heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat?   Nevertheless we, according to his promise,
look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
blameless.

 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto
him hath written unto you;  As also in all his epistles, speaking
in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be
understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they
do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
your own stedfastness.

 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.




The First Epistle General of John


 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have
handled, of the Word of life;  (For the life was manifested, and we
have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life,
which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)  That which
we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have
fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
with his Son Jesus Christ.

 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
we lie, and do not the truth  But if we walk in the light, as he
is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us.

 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
word is not in us.

 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
not.

And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous  And he is the propitiation for our sins and not
for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
commandments.

 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
liar, and the truth is not in him.

 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected hereby know we that we are in him.

 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
even as he walked.

 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is
the word which ye have heard from the beginning.

 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in
him and in you because the darkness is past, and the true light now
shineth.

 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
darkness even until now.

 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
none occasion of stumbling in him.

 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath
blinded his eyes.

 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
you for his name's sake.

 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from
the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome
the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have
known the Father.

 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that
is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye
are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome
the wicked one.

 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If
any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust
of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of
the world.

 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof but he that
doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

 Little children, it is the last time and as ye have heard that
antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we
know that it is the last time.

 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us but they went
out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father he that
acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain
in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.

 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
life.

 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
you.

 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you,
and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing
teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as
it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his
coming.

 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
doeth righteousness is born of him.

 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us
not, because it knew him not.

 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be
like him; for we shall see him as he is.

 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even
as he is pure.

 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is
the transgression of the law.

 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in
him is no sin.

 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him, neither known him.

 Little children, let no man deceive you he that doeth
righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he
might destroy the works of the devil.

 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
remaineth in him and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he
that loveth not his brother.

 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
should love one another.

 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
brother's righteous.

 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love
the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth
the love of God in him?   My little children, let us not love in
word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.

 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
hearts before him.

 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
knoweth all things.

 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God.

 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name
of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us
commandment.

 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
him.

And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath
given us.

 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the
world.

 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God Every spirit that confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God  And every spirit
that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of
God and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that
it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because
greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

 They are of the world therefore speak they of the world, and the
world heareth them.

 We are of God he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit
of error.

 Beloved, let us love one another for love is of God; and every
one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
him.

 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
hath given us of his Spirit.

 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to
be the Saviour of the world.

 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
dwelleth in him, and he in God.

 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment because as he is, so are we in this world.

 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear
because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in
love.

 We love him, because he first loved us.

 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar
for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love
God whom he hath not seen?   And this commandment have we from
him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and
every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten
of him.

 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
God, and keep his commandments.

 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments and
his commandments are not grievous.

 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is
the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
Jesus is the Son of God?   This is he that came by water and blood,
even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it
is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost and these three are one.

 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and
the water, and the blood and these three agree in one.

 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater
for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.

 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself
he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth
not the record that God gave of his Son.

 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
and this life is in his Son.

 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
God hath not life.

 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that
ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
any thing according to his will, he heareth us  And if we know
that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions
that we desired of him.

 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto
death. There is a sin unto death I do not say that he shall pray for
it.

 All unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death.

 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
wickedness.

 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and
eternal life.

 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.




The Second Epistle General of John


 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the
truth;  For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be
with us for ever.

 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,
as we have received a commandment from the Father.

 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that
we love one another.

 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk
in it.

 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
antichrist.

 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he
hath both the Father and the Son.

 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
him not into your house, neither bid him God speed  For he that
biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.

 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
paper and ink but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face,
that our joy may be full.

 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.




The Third Epistle General of John


 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be
in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of
the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.

 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.

 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
brethren, and to strangers;  Which have borne witness of thy
charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey
after a godly sort, thou shalt do well  Because that for his
name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers
to the truth.

 I wrote unto the church but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith,
neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that
would, and casteth them out of the church.

 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
He that doeth good is of God but he that doeth evil hath not seen
God.

 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself
yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.

 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write
unto thee  But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall
speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet
the friends by name.




The General Epistle of Jude


 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,
and called  Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you
that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once
delivered unto the saints.

 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our
Lord Jesus Christ.

 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,
afterward destroyed them that believed not.

 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of the great day.

 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of
eternal fire.

 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a
railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

 But these speak evil of those things which they know not but
what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they
corrupt themselves.

 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
gainsaying of Core.

 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with
you, feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water,
carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,
twice dead, plucked up by the roots;  Raging waves of the sea,
foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the
blackness of darkness for ever.

 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 
To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly
among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him.

 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in
admiration because of advantage.

 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of
the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;  How that they told you
there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their
own ungodly lusts.

 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
Spirit.

 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
praying in the Holy Ghost,  Keep yourselves in the love of God,
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

 And of some have compassion, making a difference  And others
save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment
spotted by the flesh.

 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy,  To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.




The Revelation of Saint John the Devine


 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew
unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent
and signified it by his angel unto his servant John  Who bare
record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and
of all things that he saw.

 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein for the
time is at hand.

 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you,
and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and
from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;  And from Jesus
Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the
dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved
us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,  And hath made us
kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and
dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
because of him. Even so, Amen.

 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,
and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that
is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus
Christ.

 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
great voice, as of a trumpet,  Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the
first and the last and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it
unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto
Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and
unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;  And in the midst of the
seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a
garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden
girdle.

 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
and his eyes were as a flame of fire;  And his feet like unto fine
brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of
many waters.

 And he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth
went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun
shineth in his strength.

 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his
right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the
last  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive
for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,
and the things which shall be hereafter;  The mystery of the seven
stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden
candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches
and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith
he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks;  I know thy works, and thy
labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are
evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are
not, and hast found them liars  And hast borne, and hast patience,
and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
thy first love.

 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do
the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will
remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of
life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;  I know
thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I
know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but
are the synagogue of Satan.

 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold, the
devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye
shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death, and I
will give thee a crown of life.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;  I know thy
works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is and thou
holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days
wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where
Satan dwelleth.

 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed
unto idols, and to commit fornication.

 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
against them with the sword of my mouth.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name
written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and
his feet are like fine brass;  I know thy works, and charity, and
service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to
be more than the first.

 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to
teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat
things sacrificed unto idols.

 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
repented not.

 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery
with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I
will give unto every one of you according to your works.

 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan,
as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
will I give power over the nations  And he shall rule them with a
rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to
shivers even as I received of my Father.

 And I will give him the morning star.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.

 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I
know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God.

 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on
thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon
thee.

 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their
garments; and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy.

 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment;
and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will
confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.

 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things
saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David,
he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man
openeth;  I know thy works behold, I have set before thee an open
door, and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength, and
hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they
are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come
and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.

 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep
thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world,
to try them that dwell upon the earth.

 Behold, I come quickly hold that fast which thou hast, that no
man take thy crown.

 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,
and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my
God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which
cometh down out of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my
new name.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.

 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of
the creation of God;  I know thy works, that thou art neither cold
nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot.

 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
will spue thee out of my mouth.

 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked  I counsel thee to buy
of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white
raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy
nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that
thou mayest see.

 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore,
and repent.

 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock if any man hear my voice,
and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and
he with me.

 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.

 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven and
the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with
me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must
be hereafter.

 And immediately I was in the spirit and, behold, a throne was set
in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like
unto an emerald.

 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon
the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white
raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne,
which are the seven Spirits of God.

 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal
and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four
beasts full of eyes before and behind.

 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a
calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast
was like a flying eagle.

 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night, saying,
Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to
come.

 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that
sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,  The four and
twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship
him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the
throne, saying,  Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and
honour and power for thou hast created all things, and for thy
pleasure they are and were created.

 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.

 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?   And no
man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open
the book, neither to look thereon.

 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to
read the book, neither to look thereon.

 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not behold, the Lion of
the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book,
and to loose the seven seals thereof.

 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four
beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been
slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits
of God sent forth into all the earth.

 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
sat upon the throne.

 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them
harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of
saints.

 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
book, and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain, and hast
redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation;  And hast made us unto our God kings and
priests and we shall reign on the earth.

 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was
ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory,
and blessing.

 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,
heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto
him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.

 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as
it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and
see.

 And I saw, and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a
bow; and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and
to conquer.

 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast
say, Come and see.

 And there went out another horse that was red and power was given
to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they
should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword.

 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat
on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure
of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and
see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
fourth beast say, Come and see.

 And I looked, and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on
him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto
them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with
hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the
testimony which they held  And they cried with a loud voice,
saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and
avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?   And white
robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them,
that they should rest yet for a little season, until their
fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they
were, should be fulfilled.

 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,
and the moon became as blood;  And the stars of heaven fell unto
the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is
shaken of a mighty wind.

 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and
every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the
mountains;  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and
hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
wrath of the Lamb  For the great day of his wrath is come; and
who shall be able to stand?   And after these things I saw four
angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four
winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on
the sea, nor on any tree.

 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
of the living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels,
to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,  Saying, Hurt
not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the
servants of our God in their foreheads.

 And I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were
sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the
children of Israel.

 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed
twelve thousand.

 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were
sealed twelve thousand.

 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were
sealed twelve thousand.

 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were
sealed twelve thousand.

 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,
stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white
robes, and palms in their hands;  And cried with a loud voice,
saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb.

 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces,
and worshipped God,  Saying, Amen Blessing, and glory, and
wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto
our God for ever and ever. Amen.

 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?   And I
said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they
which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
among them.

 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
the sun light on them, nor any heat.

 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes.

 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
heaven about the space of half an hour.

 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
were given seven trumpets.

 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which
was before the throne.

 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
altar, and cast it into the earth and there were voices, and
thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound.

 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled
with blood, and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of
trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea
became blood;  And the third part of the creatures which were in
the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were
destroyed.

 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of
the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;  And the name of the
star is called Wormwood and the third part of the waters became
wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made
bitter.

 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was
smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the
stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone
not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of
the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three
angels, which are yet to sound!   And the fifth angel sounded, and
I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the
key of the bottomless pit.

 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of
the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto
them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those
men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.

 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that
they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and
shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their
faces were as the faces of men.

 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as
the teeth of lions.

 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and
the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle.

 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in
their tails and their power was to hurt men five months.

 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the
Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.

 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
horns of the golden altar which is before God,  Saying to the
sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are
bound in the great river Euphrates.

 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour,
and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.

 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
thousand thousand and I heard the number of them.

 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone and
the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their
mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.

 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and
by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.

 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails for their
tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do
hurt.

 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not
worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone,
and of wood which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk  Neither
repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their
fornication, nor of their thefts.

 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it
were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire  And he had in his
hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea, and
his left foot on the earth,  And cried with a loud voice, as when
a lion roareth and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their
voices.

 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about
to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.

 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven,  And sware by him that liveth for
ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are,
and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the
things which are therein, that there should be time no longer 
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin
to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared
to his servants the prophets.

 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and
said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the
angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little
book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make
thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.

 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten
it, my belly was bitter.

 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel
stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and
them that worship therein.

 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure
it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall
they tread under foot forty and two months.

 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in
sackcloth.

 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing
before the God of the earth.

 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
mouth, and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them, he
must in this manner be killed.

 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of
their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and
to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and
shall overcome them, and kill them.

 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was
crucified.

 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall
see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer
their dead bodies to be put in graves.

 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and
make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two
prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell
upon them which saw them.

 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their
enemies beheld them.

 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven
thousand and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God
of heaven.

 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
quickly.

 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of
our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,  Saying, We
give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to
come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast
reigned.

 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give
reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them
that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which
destroy the earth.

 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings, and
voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.

 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with
the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
twelve stars  And she being with child cried, travailing in
birth, and pained to be delivered.

 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon
his heads.

 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which
was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was
born.

 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God, and to his
throne.

 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two
hundred and threescore days.

 And there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,  And
prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out
into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of
his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which
accused them before our God day and night.

 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to
the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down
unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a
short time.

 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished
for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out
of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten
crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet
were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and
the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast.

 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who
is able to make war with him?   And there was given unto him a
mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto
him to continue forty and two months.

 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues,
and nations.

 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world.

 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that
killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the
patience and the faith of the saints.

 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,  And deceiveth them
that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had
power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on
the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the
wound by a sword, and did live.

 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that
the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as
would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
foreheads  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had
the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
of the beast for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
hundred threescore and six.

 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name
written in their foreheads.

 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and
as the voice of a great thunder and I heard the voice of harpers
harping with their harps  And they sung as it were a new song
before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders and no
man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand,
which were redeemed from the earth.

 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and
to the Lamb.

 And in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault
before the throne of God.

 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,  Saying with a
loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his
judgment is come and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the
sea, and the fountains of waters.

 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the
wine of the wrath of her fornication.

 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his
forehead, or in his hand,  The same shall drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of
his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb
 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever
and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his
image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

 Here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do
follow them.

 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and
in his hand a sharp sickle.

 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap
for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is
ripe.

 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;
and the earth was reaped.

 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
also having a sharp sickle.

 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,
saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the
vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the
wrath of God.

 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a
thousand and six hundred furlongs.

 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the
wrath of God.

 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them
that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and
over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of
glass, having the harps of God.

 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song
of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God
Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.

 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou
only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for
thy judgments are made manifest.

 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened  And the seven
angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in
pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden
girdles.

 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.

 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon
the earth.

 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark
of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.

 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the
sea.

 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
fountains of waters; and they became blood.

 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged
thus.

 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of
God, which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to
give him glory.

 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their
tongues for pain,  And blasphemed the God of heaven because of
their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the
kings of the east might be prepared.

 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth
of the false prophet.

 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather
them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
tongue Armageddon.

 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,
saying, It is done.

 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth,
so mighty an earthquake, and so great.

 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
of the nations fell and great Babylon came in remembrance before God,
to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed God because of the
plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee
the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters 
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the
inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
fornication.

 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I
saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup
in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her, I wondered
with great admiration.

 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth
her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition and they that dwell on
the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of
life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that
was, and is not, and yet is.

 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven
mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

 And there are seven kings five are fallen, and one is, and the
other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short
space.

 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with
the beast.

 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
unto the beast.

 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
them for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings and they that are
with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall
hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat
her flesh, and burn her with fire.

 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God
shall be fulfilled.

 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
reigneth over the kings of the earth.

 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,
and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and
hateful bird.

 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication
with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the
abundance of her delicacies.

 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive
not of her plagues.

 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
her iniquities.

 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her
double.

 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart, I sit a
queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning,
and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is
the Lord God who judgeth her.

 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when
they shall see the smoke of her burning,  Standing afar off for
the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon,
that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.

 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
for no man buyeth their merchandise any more  The merchandise of
gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen,
and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner
vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of
brass, and iron, and marble,  And cinnamon, and odours, and
ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and
wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves,
and souls of men.

 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from
thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine
linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious
stones, and pearls!   For in one hour so great riches is come to
nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and
sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  And cried
when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto
this great city!   And they cast dust on their heads, and cried,
weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were
made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!
for in one hour is she made desolate.

 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city
Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman,
of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the
sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  And
the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all
in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy
sorceries were all nations deceived.

 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
of all that were slain upon the earth.

 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power,
unto the Lord our God  For true and righteous are his judgments
for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with
her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
hand.

 And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and
ever.

 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all
ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.

 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying,
Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him for the
marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are
the true sayings of God.

 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
thou do it not I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have
the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.

 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he
doth judge and make war.

 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name
is called The Word of God.

 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING
OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come
and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; 
That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the
flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on
them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and
great.

 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the
horse, and against his army.

 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had
received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls
were filled with their flesh.

 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,  And cast him
into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him,
that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years
should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season.

 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not
worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark
upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned
with Christ a thousand years.

 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
were finished. This is the first resurrection.

 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection
on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of
God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison,  And shall go out to deceive the nations which
are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them
together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city and fire came down
from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
tormented day and night for ever and ever.

 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no
place for them.

 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
books were opened and another book was opened, which is the book of
life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written
in the books, according to their works.

 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged
every man according to their works.

 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
second death.

 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the lake of fire.

 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they
shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their
God.

 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain for the former things are passed away.

 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new.

And he said unto me, Write for these words are true and faithful.

 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely.

 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
God, and he shall be my son.

 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all
liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone which is the second death.

 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,
saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
descending out of heaven from God,  Having the glory of God and
her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper
stone, clear as crystal;  And had a wall great and high, and had
twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written
thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
Israel  On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on
the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
breadth and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
furlongs.

The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city
was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the
second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a
chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.

 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was
of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.

 And I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it.

 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the
light thereof.

 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into
it.

 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there
shall be no night there.

 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
it.

 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie but
they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits,
and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations.

 And there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of
the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him  And
they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.

 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light and they
shall reign for ever and ever.

 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly be done.

 Behold, I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of
the prophecy of this book.

 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard
and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which
shewed me these things.

 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not for I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which
keep the sayings of this book worship God.

 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
this book for the time is at hand.

 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still and he which is
filthy, let him be filthy still and he that is righteous, let him be
righteous still and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
every man according as his work shall be.

 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
the last.

 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
city.

 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright
and morning star.

 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let
him take the water of life freely.

 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God
shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book 
And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and
out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
Amen.

Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
